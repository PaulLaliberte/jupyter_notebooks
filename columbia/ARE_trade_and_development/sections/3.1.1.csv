Generalized Preference Certificates are issued for exports to Canada46 and Russia; Certificates of Hong Kong Origin – CEPA (CO-CEPA) for exports to Mainland China; and Certificates of Hong Kong Origin – New Zealand (CO-NZ) for exports to New Zealand.47 Only registered manufacturers with verified  capability  to  perform  the  origin-conferring  processes  of  their  registered  products  may apply for COs.48""]"
