TradeNet, the single window system,  allows  declarants  who  have  obtained  the  enabling  software,  to  submit  customs declarations  and  other  required  documents  online  to  Customs  through  its  Customs  Management System (CMS).3 It allows for the electronic payment of customs duties and other taxes as well as submission of applications for import (and export) permits regulated by the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Consumer Protection (MICCP) (see below). As at June 2014, applications for import permits and authorizations from government agencies other than MICCP must be obtained directly from  the  agencies  concerned.  A  project  is  being  implemented  to  enhance  the  single  window  to gradually  integrate  these  agencies  into  the  TradeNet,  and  thus  process  all  import  permits  and effect electronic payment of applicable fees and charges electronically.', '3.3.  The customs declaration is validated by the CMS and a message is sent back to the declarant and the payment of the customs duty and other taxes (if any) is made. The customs declaration is channelled to the Customs Compliance Section.

Since  July  2013,  declarants  (including importers  and  brokers)  have  been  able  to  track  the  status  of  their  declarations  on  their  mobile phones (including the status of payment and whether the consignment has been cleared).4', ""3.4.  Mauritius'  risk-management  system  comprises  four  channels.

Certified  operators  receive  various  benefits  depending  on  the  type  of certification they obtain. These include: simplified declaration procedures, a low level of physical examination,  expedited  release  of  goods;  the  services  of  a  Customs  Relations  Manager;  and fast-track  processing  of  certificates  of  origin  and  tariff  rulings.
