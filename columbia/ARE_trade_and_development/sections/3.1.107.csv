Provisions  exist  in  Ghana's  statutes  for  duty  drawback.24  Data  was  not  available  on  the number  and  value  of  drawback  applications  and  actual  payments.  Any  company  that  uses imported  raw  materials  or  other  inputs  in  the  manufacture  of  products  that  are  exported  is  in principle  entitled  to  claim  a  duty  drawback  corresponding  to  the  amount  of  duty  paid  on  the imported  inputs.  Customs  export  documents  must  be  submitted  to  provide  evidence  of  export, together with evidence from customs authorities in the importing country. Claims must be made within twelve months of the date of export."", '3.68.  Reimbursement  depends  on  the  availability  of  funds.  According  to  industry  observers, drawback payments are extremely slow to be processed, and in many cases almost impossible to obtain. The minimum time required to process a claim is three to four months; but many claims are apparently never realized.']"
