These  provisions  appear  to  be  inconsistent  with  the  CEMAC  Directive, which not only fails to make provision for such products, but explicitly prohibits VAT exemptions or waivers as part of measures to encourage enterprise creation and investment.', '3.36.  In  order  to  remedy  the  chronic  problem  of  refund  of  VAT  in  practice,  one  new  feature in the 2012  Finance  Law  is  that  VAT  credit  can  now  be  used  to  pay  VAT,  excise  duty and customs duty.', '3.37.  One sector in which application of VAT appears to differ considerably from the ordinary law regime  is  that  of  petroleum  products.62  Kerosene,  in  principle  exempt  from  VAT  as  an  essential good, is in fact taxed (see Table 3.4); gas for household use is exempt, contrary to the Community provisions, and premium petrol and diesel fuel are taxed, but not at the common rate. The lack of clarity  in  the  definition  of  whether  or  not  goods  are  subject  to  VAT  is  a  major  problem, and is the  result  of  the  numerous  different  regulatory  texts.  According  to  press  reports, this lack of clarify  incites  unscrupulous  operators  to  declare  taxable  products  as  exempt  when they are imported.', ""3.38.  Furthermore,  the  VAT  regime  for  petroleum  appears  to  be  contrary  to  the  principle of neutrality  of  VAT  because  it  affects  certain  operations  in  the  petroleum  product  distribution chain  in  different  ways.  When  distributing  petroleum  products,  for  example,  premium  petrol and diesel  fuel  are  subject  to  a  specific  VAT  (per  litre  of  product  sold)  and  non-ad  valorem rate (19.25%).  VAT  is  in fact  used  by  the  authorities  to  absorb  fluctuations  in  global  prices  and their effect on the price at the pump by modifying the amount. Trading companies also complain that  they  are  unable  to  comply  with  the  VAT  on  consumers  (for  example,  distribution  within the country,  deliveries  in  towns,  storage  with  the  Cameroon  Oil  Storage  Company  (SCDP)), themselves  being  subject  to  the  common  rate.  This  problem  is  particularly  serious  because  VAT on petroleum products accounts for a large proportion of the State's revenue, indicating the need for a comprehensive revision of the VAT on petroleum products."", '3.39.
