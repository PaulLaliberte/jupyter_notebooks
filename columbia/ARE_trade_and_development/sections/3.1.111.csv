There  exists  a  scheme  of  industrial  estates,  which  provide  companies  located  inside  with better access to infrastructure (e.g. road access, electricity, and telecommunications). In industrial estates, the Government leases land to companies, regardless of the ownership, for 99 years at a concessionary  rate  of  G$1  per  square  foot.  Guyana  has  four  government-managed  industrial estates:  Eccles,  Coldingen,  Berbice-Belvedere  and  Lethem.  Applications  for  a  plot  in  the  estates must be submitted to the Department of Industrial Development, and approved by the Minister of Tourism, Industry and Commerce.', '3.96.  All  plots  in  Eccles  and  Coldingen  have  been  allocated  but  not  fully  developed  (90%  for Eccles,  and  75%  for  Coldingen).  Industries  operating  in  the  estates  currently  engage  in  various activities  such  as  food  processing,  fish  processing,  pharmaceuticals,  and  wood  processing.  The authorities estimated that these industrial estates created about 3,000 jobs in the last five years.', '3.97.   Guyana  launched  a  ""Micro-  and  Small  Enterprise  Development  and  Building  Alternative Livelihoods  for  Vulnerable  Groups""  (MSED)  project  on  14  October  2013.  The  MSED  project provides interest subsidies (up to 5%) and credit guarantee (equivalent to 40% of loan) for micro- and small enterprises.44 Under the MSED project, the maximum amount of loan facility available for each borrower is US$150,000; before the end of April 2015, 21 loans with the total amount of US$600,000 had been approved. In addition, a small amount of grant (G$300,000) were offered to  small  businesses  in  17  sectors  deemed  as  ""low  carbon  sectors"".  The  low  carbon  sectors  are identified  in  the  Guyana  Low  Carbon  Development  Strategy,  and  include  fruits  and  vegetables, aquaculture, business process outsourcing and ecotourism.45', '3.98.  The Linden Economic Advancement Programme (LEAP) was discontinued in 2010; currently the remaining operation is focused on collecting the outstanding loans. Furthermore, as stipulated in the Small Business Act, the Government must use its best endeavours to meet at least 20% of its  procurement  requirements  of  goods  and  services  from  small  businesses.  The  Small  Business Council does not have information on whether and how much procurement was awarded to small business.']"
