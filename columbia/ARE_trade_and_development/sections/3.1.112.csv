During  the  review  period,  Korea  continued  to  promote  or  induce  FDI  (including joint-ventures  with  domestic  investors)  with  the  operation  of  foreign  investment  zones  (FIZs), export-oriented  free  trade  zones  (FTZs),  and  free  economic  zones  (FEZs)  that  are  divided  into complex-type,  individual-type  and  service-type  zones  (Section  2.6).205  Their  location  varies  in terms  of  eligibility  for  occupation,  targeted  industries,  and  investment  incentives  in  form  of  rent reduction/fixing, customs  duty/VAT exemption, and cash grant, depending on their purpose of designation (Table A2.2). The eligibility for  and  extent  of  these  incentives  depends  on  certain  criteria,  including  the  degree  of  FDI participation.206  This  assistance  was  notified  to  the  WTO  pursuant  to  Article  XVI:1  of  the  GATT 1994  and  Article  25  of  the  Agreement  on  Subsidies  and  Countervailing  Measures  in  2013  and 2015.207  According  to  the  2015  WTO  notification,  the  amount  of  cash  grants  resulting  from  this type of support stood at ₩14 billion in 2011, ₩10 billion in 2012, ₩5.8 billion in 2013, and about ₩20 billion in 2014; in addition, according to national statistics, the support in the form of forgone tax  revenue  from  the  reduction  or  exemption  of  corporation  tax  for  all  foreign-invested corporations  in  FIZs  and  FEZs  stood  at  ₩170  billion  in  2011,  ₩80  billion  in  2012,  ₩44  billion  in 2013,  and  ₩57  billion  in  2014.208  As  of  end-2015,  there  were  98  FIZs,  13  FTZs  and  8  FEZs; between  2012  and  2014,  no  new  foreign  direct  investment  promoting  sites  were  set  except  for four new complex-type FIZs (Cheonan, Woljeon, Munmak, and Jincheon-Sansu). As of 2015, total FDI  in  these  zones,  where  682  companies  employing  149,000  persons  operated,  amounted  to US$14 billion.  No  data  on  the  share  of  these  zones'  contribution  to  Korea's  GDP  and  total imports/exports were available from the authorities."", '3.168.  Industrial  complexes  specializing  in  parts  and  materials  –  a  complex-type  of  FIZ  that,  in addition  to  other  incentives,  benefits  from  100%  rent  reduction  (compared  to  75%  at  general complex-type  FIZs)  –  are,  inter  alia,  expected  to  facilitate  the  introduction  of  advanced  foreign technology in parts and materials (from Japan, Germany, etc.) by inducing foreign investment.209 At  the  time  of  the  previous  Review,  five  such  complexes  operated  in  Gumi,  Pohang,  Iksan,  and Changwon  as  well  as  the  Busan-Jinhae  FEZ  due,  inter  alia,  to  their  proximity  to  large  Korean companies.  Targeted  industries  included  display,  mobile,  electronic  materials,  electronics,  steel, shipbuilding, shipbuilding materials, automotive, machinery, equipment, and chemicals. No similar information for the current review period was available from the authorities.']"
