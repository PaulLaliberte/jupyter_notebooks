The  Trade  Development  Authority  of  Pakistan  (TDAP)  under  the  Ministry  of  Commerce succeeded the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB) in 2006 and has pursued a more holistic strategy with respect to global trade development compared to its predecessor. TDAP is the implementing institution of various trade policy initiatives announced by the Commerce Ministry.', ""3.58.  Exporters must have a national tax number and a sales tax registration number. In general, exporters do not have to be registered with TDAP. However, all exporters of food products must be registered with their respective associations and, if no such entity exists, mandatory registration with  TDAP  is  required.51  Reforms  to  expedite  the  flow  of  trade  have  made  incremental  progress since 1998, but the launch of Pakistan Customs WeBOC system appear to have provided a more complete  and  largely  automated  platform,  including  a  risk  management  system,  upon  which customs  clearance  of  exports  may  now  be  evaluated.  According  to  the  authorities,  98%  of  all exports  cargo  is  presently  cleared  through  the  green  and  yellow  channels  which  allows  for  a speedier release of the products and does not involve a physical examination of the consignment. Exports passing through the red channel incur a physical inspection and assessment with delays of 2-4  days  on  average.  According  to  the  authorities,  exports  require  five  documents,  i.e.  bill-of-lading, commercial invoice, customs export declaration, e-form and packing list. According to the World  Bank's  Doing  Business  survey  for  2014,  exporting  a  standard  container  of  goods  requires eight documents, takes 21 days and costs US$660. The authorities emphasize that while delays beyond  the  average  2-4  days  are  characteristic  of  the  red  channel,  additional  delays  can  be attributed to congested ports and administrative procedures not associated with customs. The FBR monitors  exports  to  Afghanistan  through  its  13  field  Collectorates.  In  addition,  a  separate Directorate of Transit Trade has been created by the FBR to monitor all transit activity to and from Afghanistan. Transit goods are not subject to any rebate, duty drawback or refund. According to the Export Policy Order 201352; special procedures and authorized border crossings must be used.

In  addition,  rice  exports  are subject  to  minimum  export  prices  (see  Section  4).  Hot  water  treatment  for  mangoes  to  be exported to the European Union is mandatory. While PSQCA has legislative quality inspection and testing responsibilities for exports, its role is apparently relatively minor.', '3.60.

The export of gold jewellery must take place within 120 days of importing the gold; failing that, duties and taxes plus a 5% penalty for the first month and 10% thereafter are imposed. Unless sales receipts are realized within 240 days from export, a monthly 1% penalty of sale proceeds is incurred.']"
