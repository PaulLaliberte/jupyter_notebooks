Since  2014,  work  on  streamlining  foreign  trade  procedures  and  formalities  has  been  taking place under Brazil's Single Window Programme (Programa Portal Único de Comércio Exterior). The programme's focus is on optimizing the interventions and information flows among all stakeholders involved in the import, export and transit of goods. Unless exempted, commercial imports must be declared  in  the  Integrated  Foreign  Trade  System  (SISCOMEX),  which  is  being  redesigned  to become a full-fledged single window for trade in goods by the end of 2018.1"", ""3.2.  Access to SISCOMEX is managed by the Secretariat of Federal Revenue of Brazil (RFB), which issues  user  accreditations  (habilitação)  free  of  charge  and  with  unlimited  validity.  Depending  on their  estimated  financial  capacity,  applicants  may  qualify  for  one  of  the  following  three accreditation  types: express  (c.i.f. value  of  imports capped  at  US$50,000  per semester)2;  limited (c.i.f.  value  of  imports  capped  at  US$150,000  per  semester);  or  unlimited.3  According  to  the authorities,  the  transaction  value  caps  associated  with  the  first  two  accreditation  types  are maintained for risk-mitigation purposes. To qualify for an unlimited accreditation, importers must demonstrate  that  their  actual  financial  capacity  exceeds  US$150,000  per  semester.4  If  an applicant's  request  for  accreditation/revision  of  financial  capacity  estimate  has  been  rejected,  a subsequent application would not be considered in the six months following the rejection.5"", '3.3.  Upon completing their first transaction in SISCOMEX, importers are automatically registered in  the  Registry  of  Exporters  and  Importers  (REI)  maintained  by  the  Secretariat  of  Foreign  Trade (SECEX)  at the Ministry of Industry,  Foreign Trade and Services (MDIC). Inscription in the REI  is free of charge and with unlimited validity, but may be suspended (for up to two years) or cancelled as  a  sanction  for  import-related  fraud.6  Import  transactions  with  payment  terms  exceeding 360 days remain subject to registration with the Central Bank.7', ""3.4.

Depending  on  the  type  of  AEO  certification,  participants\'  benefits  may  include:  a dedicated communication channel with the RFB; a lower rate of document and physical inspections on  importation  and/or  exportation;  expedited  clearance  at  ports  of  entry;  a  40-day  deadline  for the provision of advance rulings; and simplified accreditation (habilitação) for access to SISCOMEX and  special  customs  regimes  and/or  zones.  At  31  January  2017,  the  RFB  had  received 343 applications  for  AEO  certifications,  of  which  95  were  approved  and  205  were  refused.  The authorities\'  aim  is  that  AEOs  would  account  for  50%  of  all  registered  import  and  export declarations by 2019.19 Brazil has concluded a mutual recognition agreement on AEO programmes with  Uruguay  and  is  developing  joint  work  programmes  to  this  end  with  Argentina  and  the United States.

The  risk  analysis factors are regularly updated and include: the importer's fiscal compliance record; operational and financial  capacity;  frequency  of  use  of  SISCOMEX;  the  nature,  volume,  and  value  of  imports; taxation  value;  country  of  origin;  and  the  import  regime.
