Developing  transit  trade  has  been  one  of  the  Government's  main  strategic  initiatives. Georgia's location provides an alternative transit route into central Asia, other than the routes via China  and  the  Russian  Federation.  The  Government  thus  has  been  establishing  free  industrial zones (FIZs), where investors may conduct processing activities in Georgia in connection with the transit of goods without being subject to Georgian taxes. Incentives, in the form of a special tax regime, have been provided to companies operating in FIZs (Table 3.12)."", '3.87.  FIZs are regulated under the Law on Free Industrial Zones, adopted in 2007. FIZs may be established  either  by  the  initiative  of  the  Government,  or  upon  requests  of  natural  or  legal persons.  FIZs  are  created  to  promote  the  inflow  of  capital,  technology  and  know-how.  Financial operations in FIZs can be carried out in any currency. Currently Georgia has four free industrial zones  (FIZs):  Poti  (established  in  2009),  Kutaisi  (established  in  2009),  Kulevi  (in  2012),  and Kutaisi’s Hualing (established in 2015).', '3.88.  Goods produced or assembled in FIZs are allowed to be sold in the domestic market. When enterprises from FIZs sell goods to Georgian entities other than those in FIZs, they must pay 4% of their gross income from the sale to the Government. The following activities are prohibited in the FIZs:', '\uf0b7', '\uf0b7', '\uf0b7', '\uf0b7', 'production of and/or trade in arms and munitions;', 'production of and/or trade in nuclear and radioactive substances;', 'import, storage, production and/or sale of narcotic and psychotropic substances; and', 'import,  storage,  production  and/or  sale  of  tobacco  and/or  raw  materials  for  tobacco production except for cases of use only (which is not considered as an export of goods).', ""3.89.  The authorities consider that the FIZs, through their more liberal tax regime and simplified administrative  procedures,  help  to  attract  FDI  and  thus  new/modern  technologies,  increase employment and investment in human resources. They also consider that by promoting exports, these  FIZs  contribute  to  export  diversification  and  to  reducing  Georgia's  external  vulnerabilities. They  also  contribute  to  regional  development,  and  the  development  of  cargo  transportation  and related services.""]"
