In December 2010, Cabo Verde informed the WTO that it was facing certain difficulties in implementing the Agreement.

New tools such as a customs valuation database and an automated risk analysis and management system would be required to reduce as much as possible the time needed to control goods submitted for customs clearance. Further work should also be undertaken to familiarize users with the new Customs Code (adopted in 2010) and to  draft  supplementary  legal  instruments.  Cabo  Verde  therefore  requested  that  it  be  granted a temporary  waiver  to  implement  the  Customs  Valuation  Agreement  by  1  January  2012, and presented  a  revised  action  plan  to  implement  it.43  WTO  Members  granted  the  waiver  in May 2011, on the condition that Cabo Verde should report to the Committee on Customs Valuation on progress in fulfilling the action plan and on the status of implementation of the Agreement by 30 September  2011.

In  addition,  compared  to  the  previous  Community  Customs  Code  (CCC),  other  elements were modified or added by the adoption of the UCC.

In  some  cases,  provisions  that  were  previously  in  the  CCC  were  not  included  in the  UCC,  but  rather  in  the  implementing  rules,  regulations,  or  guidelines.  Thus,  the  Commission has  indicated  that  changes  that  were  taken  out  of  the  legislation  may  come  back  through guidelines.  Among  these  modifications,  several  are  particularly  significant  (Table  3.3).  The  new rules  provide  that  the  sale  occurring  immediately  before  the  entry  of  the  goods  into  the  EU customs territory is the relevant sale for the application of the transaction value method; and the notion  of  ""condition  of  sale""  referred  to  in  royalties  and  licence  fees  has,  according  to  the Commission, been clarified in accordance with the most recent WCO guidance and thus led to re-alignment  of  its  own  rules  where  there  were  inconsistencies.

Panama  started  to  implement  the  Customs  Valuation  Agreement  (CVA)  in  full  in  January 1997 pursuant  to  Cabinet  Decree  No. 26  of  1 August 1996  and  the  resolutions  implementing  it.19 Moreover,  Decree  Law  No. 1  of  2008  (Article  109)  provides  that  the  determination  of  customs value is to be governed by the CVA and its annexes.', '3.39.  Pursuant to the CVA, in Panama customs valuation of imported goods is first and foremost based on the transaction value. If it is necessary to use alternative methods of valuation, Panama also  follows  the  provisions  in  the  CVA.  The  authorities  have  indicated  that  the  transaction  value applies to 99% of declarations.', '3.40.  Decree  Law  No. 1  of  2008  empowers  ANA  to  determine  that  some  imports  are  subject  to mandatory consultation with the Valuation Department prior to clearance if there is a justified risk because of their source, origin, value, nature or condition. Such goods must be valued according to objective and quantifiable criteria following general accounting practices and in conformity with the  CVA,  Cabinet  Decree  No. 26  of  1 August 1996  and  the  general  regulations  issued  by  the customs  authority.20  Under  Resolution  No. 230  of  29 September 2011,  ANA  introduced  a  ""Sworn Declaration of Value"" form for goods subject to mandatory prior consultation.21 This declaration is an  instrument  signed  by  the  importer  or  his  legal  representative  in  which  he  declares,  on  oath, the existence and terms of a commercial transaction so that controls may be conducted prior to clearance, when there is a justified risk.

Panama notified its customs legislation to the WTO and replied to the checklist of issues on enforcement  and  administration  of  the  CVA  in  1998.23  It  also  notified  that,  since  October 1997, it had  applied  the  CVA's  decisions  on  the  treatment  of  interest  charges  in  the  customs  value of imported  goods  and  the  valuation  of  carrier  media  bearing  software  for  data-processing equipment.24"", '3.42.  The legislation includes provisions on disagreement regarding the customs value of goods.25 Where  ANA  has  reason  to  doubt  the  declared  value  before  accepting  the  declaration,  it  may request  further  information  from  the  declarant.  If  ANA  continues  to  entertain  reasonable  doubts after it has received this information, it may decide that the customs value of the goods cannot be determined using the transaction value and informs the declarant in writing of the reasons for its decision,  which  is  binding.  The  importer  has  the  right  to  lodge  an  appeal,  without  any  penalty, within a period of three  working days of the notification of the decision and before the customs declaration  is  accepted.  If  a  first-instance  appeal  has  been  made  to  the  Regional  Administrator, a second-instance  appeal  may  be  made  to  the  Tariff  Commission  within  eight  working  days following notification of the ruling given in the first instance. The decision by the Tariff Commission exhausts government channels and so the next recourse would be through administrative litigation channels.', '3.43.  If an import declaration has already been submitted and during clearance of the goods the customs  official  has  reasonable  doubts  concerning  the  declared  value,  the  documents  are forwarded to the Regional Administrator, who has to take a decision within a period not exceeding 30  days,  indicating  whether  or  not  there  is  a  discrepancy.  Once  the  decision  has  been  notified, the interested party may appeal to the Tariff Commission within eight days. In any event, if the importer manages to dispel the reasonable doubt, ANA notifies the interested party of acceptance of  the  declared  value.  If,  on  the  other hand, it is  determined that the importer has falsified the information, ANA may order the initiation of an investigation into a customs offence. According to data  from  ANA,  between  January 2009  and  October 2013  there  were  33  complaints  against decisions by the Customs with regard to the value of goods, of which three went forward to the Tariff Commission. Five of these cases concerned the value of used vehicles.', '3.44.  By Resolution No. 072 of 10 September 2009, ANA provisionally suspended the application of Resolutions No. 704-04-528 of 1 October 1997 and No. 704-04-019 of 10 January 1997, which set  out  the  provisions  for  determining  the  customs  value  of  used  goods  in  general  and  of  used vehicles, respectively. Consequently, Cabinet Decree No. 26 of 1 August 1996 currently applies to both  new  and  used  goods.  The  authorities  have  indicated  that,  in  2012,  100%  of  new  vehicles and 99.7% of used vehicles were valued according to the transaction value. They stated, however, that some cases of alleged under-invoicing of used vehicles were being investigated.']"

The valuation methodology did not change relative to the 2002 Customs Code, but the control  procedures  have  been  simplified  and  verification  processes  are  now  completed  after  the release of goods for free circulation. Specifically, the Ukrainian authorities note that customs value declarations36  are  no  longer  needed  for  transactions  valued  at  less  than  €5,000,  and  the declarations are only used above this threshold when the buyers and sellers are related, or when the customs value is determined by adjustments involving the value of components or parts. The right of the customs authorities to request additional documentation is now more limited and more clearly  defined  than  in  the  past.  The  customs  authorities  may  only  adjust  the  declared  value  if (i) the value is factually incorrect (e.g. calculation mistakes or the application of a wrong exchange rate); (ii) the basic documentation (e.g. invoice) is missing; (iii) the selected valuation method is inconsistent  with  the  Customs  Code;  or  (iv)  the  customs  authorities  of  other  countries  have advised that the declared value is unreliable.

For  authorized  economic operators (AEOs), documentation requirements will be restricted to the customs value declaration, the  contract,  the  invoice,  bank  payment  documents,  and  proof  of  transportation  and  insurance costs.
