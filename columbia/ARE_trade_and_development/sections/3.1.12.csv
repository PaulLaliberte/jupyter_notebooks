In  accordance  with  Article 31  of  the  AML,  acquisitions  by  foreign  investors  of  domestic enterprises considered to be related to national security must undergo a national security review. If,  as  a  result  of  the  review,  the  proposed  merger  is  not  granted  national  security  clearance, MOFCOM  must,  jointly  with  other  relevant  authorities,  terminate  the  merger  transaction  or  take action to eliminate the negative impact on national security caused by the merger.', '3.160.  The Security Review System for the Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign  Investors  was  formally  implemented  in  March  2011  through  the  Notice  of  the  General Office of the State Council on Launching the Security Review System for Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors (Guo Ban Fa [2011] No. 6), which entered into force on 5 March 2011. In 2015, the Notice of the General Office of the State Council on Printing and Distributing the Trial Measures for the National Security Review of Foreign Investment in Pilot Free Trade Zones (Guo Ban Fa [2015] No. 24) was published and implemented to explore and improve the  system  for  national  security  review  of  foreign  investments  which  is  expected  to  match  the negative list management mode. The procedures to conduct national security reviews conducted by  MOFCOM  are  contained  in  the  MOFCOM  Rules  on  Implementing  the  National  Security  Review Mechanism  for  Mergers  and  Acquisitions  of  Domestic  Enterprises  by  Foreign  Investors  (MOFCOM Announcement  No.  2011/53),  which  entered  into  force  on  1  September  2011.  National  security reviews  are  conducted  by  the  Inter-Ministerial  Joint  Conference  on  National  Security  Review  of Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, led by the NDRC and MOFCOM.', '3.161.  Mergers  and  acquisitions  of  domestic  enterprises  by  foreign  investors  are  subject  to national  security  review  in  the  following  cases:  defence-related  activities,  which  include  the acquisition  of  defence  or  defence-affiliated  enterprises,  as  well  as  the  purchase  of  enterprises located near defence facilities; and the acquisition of, and gaining control over, enterprises related to  national  security  engaged  in  the  production  of  key  agricultural  products,  energy  and  natural resources,  as  well  as  key  infrastructure,  transportation,  and  machinery  manufacturing.  The prospective investor must apply for the review.', '3.162.  National  security  reviews  can  have  one  or  two  stages:  a  general  review  and  a  special review.  The  general  review  is  carried  out  by  the  Inter-Ministerial  Joint  Conference  to  which MOFCOM refers the proposed merger and must be completed within 30 working days and carried out by means of written opinion solicitation. The Joint Conference seeks opinions in writing from the relevant departments under a strict time frame. If the relevant departments reach a consensus that  the  concerned  transaction  will  not  have  any  impact  on  national  security,  the  concentration operation may proceed. However, if the relevant departments determine that the transaction may have  an  impact  on  national  security,  the  Joint  Conference  initiates  the  procedures  for  a  special review, issues review opinions within five working days upon the receipt of all the written opinions, and informs MOFCOM of this in writing. Review opinions are issued only when there is a general consensus.  When  there  are  major  different  views,  the  Joint  Conference  submits  the  case  to  the', '\x0cWT/TPR/S/342 • China', '- 91 -', 'State  Council  for  a  decision.  The  Joint  Conference  must  complete  the  special  review  within 60 working days of the launch of the procedures.', '3.163.  The Notice of the General Office of the State Council on Printing and Distributing the Trial Measures for the National Security Review of Foreign Investment in Pilot Free Trade Zones (Guo Ban Fa [2015] No. 24), in force since 8 May 2015, governs national security reviews in PFTZs.169 The  rules  of  the  reviews  for  PFTZs  follow  the  general  negative  list  approach  to  investment  that prevails  in  the  zones.  To  this  end,  the  Notice  defines  the  scope  of  the  reviews,  which  covers: investment in PFTZs by foreign investors in: the military industry or related supporting industries or other fields involving national security; regions near key and sensitive military facilities; fields such  as  agriculture,  energy  and  resources,  key  infrastructure,  transport  services,  culture, information technologies  and  equipment manufacturing, in which the foreign investors acquire the actual controlling right.170 The security review  of  foreign  investment  in  the  financial  sector  is  not  covered  by  these  procedures  and  is subject  to  separate  ones.  For  investors  from  Hong  Kong,  China;  and  Macao,  China  these  rules apply only as a reference.', 'technology  products  and  services;  and  key', '3.164.  The  Notice  mandates  that,  when  handling  the  formalities  for  foreign  investment  record-filing, ratification or examination and approval within their authorities, PFTZ management organs must notify, in a timely manner, prospective foreign investors in areas falling within the scope of security reviews that they must apply for the review prior to engaging in any investment-related formalities.  The  review  will  analyse  the  impact  of  the  foreign  investment  on:  national  security, including  on  domestic  manufacturing  capacity  and  domestic  service  provision  capacity;  the national economy; order, local culture and public morality; security; and the R&D capacity of key technologies  related  to  national  security.  The  NDRC  and  MOFCOM  conduct  the  review  in conjunction  with  the  relevant  departments  of  the  fields  related  to  the  foreign  investment.  The procedures are similar to those for reviews outside the zones.', ""3.165.  If the review determines that the investment will or may affect national security but that the  effect  can  be  eliminated  by  imposing  additional  conditions,  the  Inter-Ministerial  Joint Conference  may  require  the  foreign  investors  to  issue  a  written  commitment  to  revise  the investment plan. After the foreign investors have issued this written commitment, the Conference may impose additional conditions to approve the merger. MOFCOM notifies in writing the foreign investors and the PFTZ management organs of the Conference's review opinions.""]"
