In the DRC, the State may withdraw from economic activities in one of the following ways: (i) by selling shares in all or part of the assets or all or part of the equity capital of a State-owned enterprise and (ii) through public-private partnerships (concession, lease, management contract, subcontracting arrangement, technical assistance, etc.). However, withdrawal remains based on a partnership between the State and the private sector.', '3.143.  In 2015, none of the 20 commercial companies resulting from the conversion process was the subject of a State withdrawal by transfer of ownership. In fact, State-owned enterprises may be recapitalized by the participation of foreign or domestic private partners in their capital only at the  end  of  the  conversion  process  and  in  accordance  with  the  withdrawal  option  that  the Government  has  defined  for  each  enterprise,  with  account  for  its  nature  and  the  economic  and social impact of its activities.', '3.144.  Moreover,  the  Congolese  legislator  has  set  preliminary  conditions  for  State  withdrawal from an enterprise. These relate, in particular, to the evaluation of the net worth of the enterprise concerned;  the  determination  of  the  strategic  sectors  and  the  share  that  the  State  intends  to retain; seeking the most favourable terms; the promotion of local entrepreneurship; the rights of the  employees  and  all  other  social  aspects;  the  ending  of  the  monopoly  and  the  prohibition  of abuse  of  a  dominant  position;  diversifying  the  State  portfolio  and  making  it  profitable;  and  the recovery of the enterprise concerned.', '3.145.

State  participation  in  the  economy  through  public  enterprises  or  parastatals  remains substantial and has in fact increased in recent years. Public enterprises accounted for 8% of GDP in 2011 and collectively held assets worth almost EUR 10 billion.', '3.91.  Currently, there are 72 public enterprises operating across key economic sectors, including agriculture, transport, finance, public utilities, business promotion, tourism, health and education (Table 3.5). The Government holds shares ranging from 75% to 100% in 50 of these enterprises (Category A enterprises) and has minority shares in the remaining 22 (Category B). As many as 32  public  enterprises  are  heavily  reliant  on  government  subsidies  for  carrying  out  their  activity, while only a few are self-sustained. Most Category B enterprises are profit-making.39', '3.92.  Each  public  enterprise  is  governed  by  a  board  of  directors,  which  is  accountable  to  the relevant  line  Minister.  Many  public  enterprises  are  statutory  companies  created  by  Acts  of Parliament  and  are  subject  to  the  Public  Enterprise  Control  and  Monitoring  Act  1989;  some recently corporatized companies are governed by the Company Law 2009.40', '3.93.   The  Public  Enterprise  Unit  (PEU)  in  the  Ministry  of  Finance  is  tasked  with  monitoring, reporting  and  providing  advice  on  the  performance  of  public  enterprises.

Efforts to rationalize and privatize the parastatal sector began in the mid-1990s, within the framework  of  the  Economic  and  Social  Reform  Agenda,  but  they  were  not  carried  out  due  to unfavourable economic and political conditions.42 A privatization policy was approved by Cabinet in 2006 and was supplemented by a Privatization Road Map (PRM) in 2007.

Implementation  of  the  PRM  has  been  very  slow  as necessary legislative reforms often encounter considerable delays.', '3.95.  During  the  review  period,  the  Government  continued  the  implementation  of  the  PRM, focusing  on  corporatization  and  restructuring  of  some  public  utilities,  rather  than  on  divestiture. For example, in 2007 the Swaziland Electricity Board, which had both operational and regulatory functions,  was  replaced  by  the  new  state-owned  Swaziland  Electricity  Company  and  a  new regulatory  authority  for  the  electricity  sector  was  created.  Similarly,  legislation  passed  in  2013 separated the regulatory and commercial functions of the Swaziland Post and Telecommunication Corporation (SPTC) and established the Swaziland Communication Commission as an independent regulator  for  the  sector,  while  SPTC  continued  operations  as  a  state-owned  corporation (Section 4).', '3.96.  Nevertheless,  some  public  enterprises  continue  to  have  regulatory  functions  in  sectors where  they  compete  with  private  companies,  giving  rise  to  conflicts  of  interest  and  an  uneven playing  field  for  competition.  For  instance,  certain  public  enterprises  have  the  power  to  issue import permits and collect import levies on products with which they compete themselves. These products include maize, rice, milk, fruit and vegetables, and poultry.', '3.97.  Poor  performance,  lack  of  commercial  orientation,  and  insufficient  transparency43  and accountability are some of the problems facing the parastatal sector. Moreover, given that about half  of  public  enterprises  depend  on  government  subsidies  to  conduct  their  activities,  they represent a heavy financial and administrative burden to the Government and ultimately the tax-payers. In early 2015, the Ministry of Finance developed a Dividend  Policy on Public Enterprises which  sets  out  guidelines  for  the  payment  of  dividends  by  all  public  enterprises  based  on  the nature of their activities, in order to ensure that an appropriate return is made to the Government as a shareholder. The policy will become effective after it is approved by the Cabinet.', '3.98.
