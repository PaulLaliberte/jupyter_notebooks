Since  1996,  preshipment  inspection  has  been  mandatory  in  the  CAR  for  all  imports and exports  of  a  f.o.b.  value  of  CFAF 500,000  or  higher.  Some  products  are  exempted automatically,  whilst  other  exemptions  may  be  permitted.36  Applications  for  exemptions  must be submitted by the importer in writing to the Ministry responsible for trade. Some products are exempt  from  preshipment  inspection,  namely:  precious  metals,  works  of  art,  explosives,  postal parcels,  the  plants  and  seeds  and  floricultural  products.37  Precious  stones  are  inspected  by the BECDOR before export.', '3.7.  Since  June 2006,  BIVAC  Veritas  has  been  retained  by  the  Government  to  carry  out preshipment  inspection on behalf of the CAR.38 Under the contract, BIVAC inspection covers the verification  of  documents,  quality,  quantity,  price,  origin,  tariff  position,  customs  value  of  goods imported  into  the  CAR,  sealing  of  containers,  eligibility  of  goods  for  a  particular  customs procedure, as well as specific aspects (for example, the control of pharmaceuticals must cover the dates of manufacture and the use-by dates). At least five days must be allowed for preshipment inspection.  This  measure  is  not  based  on  any  new  regulation.  Intra-CEMAC  imports  are  also subject to preshipment inspection.', '3.8.  Inspection  is  done  at  the  place  of  production,  storage  or  dispatch  and  the  importer  must provide the BIVAC Bureau Veritas with the commercial import declaration (DIC) validated by the inspection company, approved and signed by the Ministry responsible for trade; Also required are a  copy  of  the  bank  receipt  showing  registration  of  the  import;  and  a  copy  of  the  pro  forma invoice/purchase order and a receipt for the inspection fees. The inspection procedure gives rise to an  inspection  report.  Once  the  inspection  is  done,  BIVAC  issues  the  verification  certificate, which is then required for the customs clearance of the goods.', '3.9.  The preshipment inspection fees payable by the importer are relatively high (common report, Chapter  3.1.2)  The  fees  are  borne  by  the  importer  and  are  1%  of  the  f.o.b.  value,  with a minimum of  CFAF  140,000  (€213)  for  commercial  import  declarations  subject  to  inspection, and CFAF 20,000 for other commercial import declarations. Bivac issues no document other than the DIC.', 'for', 'individual', 'imports', 'is  28%  (corresponding  to  the', '3.10.  At  the  rate  of  1%,  the  minimum  fee  (flat  rate)  of  CFAF  140,000  corresponds  in  principle to imports  worth  CFAF 14 million  a  relatively  high  amount into the Central African  Republic.  Put  another  way,  in  practice,  most  of  the  imports  subject  to inspection are worth less than this amount, and are therefore subject to rates higher than 1%; the maximum  rate imports worth CFAF 500,000). The importer must also pay 19% VAT on the fee. The cost of this mandatory inspection  programme  to  the  Central  African  economy  is  enormous.  Despite  its  objectives, the mandatory nature of this inspection increases the cost of imports by the amount of the fees (especially  the  flat  rate)  payable  by  the  importer,  and  duplicates  the  work  of  the  Customs. Besides,  neither  the  ""commercial  import  declaration""  made  to  BIVAC  nor  the  related  import verification certificate exists in electronic form. The BIVAC inspection company is not electronically linked to the computerized customs platform (ASYCUDA), and this complicates and further slows down the import process.', 'flat  rate  of  CFAF 140,000  on', '3.11.  According  to  authorities,  two  scanners  have  been  bought  with  funding  from  China  in  the framework of cooperation between both countries, and a 0.5% scanner management fee is levied on all imports, whether scanned or not.', ""3.12.  At  the  importer's  request  and  upon  authorization  by  the  customs,  inspection  at  the destination is possible subject to a penalty of CFAF 300,000 (20% of the customs value in case of a repeat offence) in addition to the inspection fees."", '36 The following are exempt from BIVAC inspection: precious stones; precious metals; works of art;', 'ammunition and arms other than for hunting and/or sporting purposes, similar materials and equipment imported by the army itself for its own use; live animals; printed and developed cinematographic films; regularly published newspapers and periodicals; and postal parcels.', '37 Interministerial Order No. 182 of 13 February 2004 issued by the Minister for Planning, Economy,', 'Finance, Budget and International Cooperation.', '38 Interministerial Order No. 038/MFB/MCIPME of 17 June 2006.', '\x0cWT/TPR/S/285 • CAR', '- 327 -', '3.13.
