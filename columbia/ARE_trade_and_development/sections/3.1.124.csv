At exportation, the goods undergo controls carried out by the OCC, which charges fees for its services (Table A3.3).', '3.114.  The  quantitative  restrictions  (including  prohibitions)  and  controls  applicable  to  exports stem  mainly  from  the  treaties  to  which  the  DRC  is  party.49  However,  for  economic  reasons, restrictions are maintained on exports of unrefined mineral ores and logs, with the operators being required to carry out first-stage processing on Congolese soil.', '3.115.  In principle, domestic legislation authorizes the export of unrefined mineral ores only on an exceptional basis. Thus, the owner of the mineral rights must apply to the Directorate of Mines for authorization to export mineral ore for processing or marketing, subject to the payment of filing fees amounting, in Congolese francs, to the equivalent of US$280 for mineral substances classified in  the  mining  category  and  US$200  for  those  classified  in  the  quarrying  category.50  In  his application, the owner of the rights must demonstrate the advantages of such a transaction for the DRC. Moreover, he must prove that the ore cannot be processed in DCR territory at lower cost. In practice, however, this export restriction is rarely observed by the country’s mining companies.', '3.116.
