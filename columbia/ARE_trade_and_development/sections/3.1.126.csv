The domestic competition legal framework, formed by the Law on Competition70 and the Law  on  State  Aid71,  aims  to  maintain  a  competitive  market  and  is  particularly  intended  to transpose EU provisions into national law.72 The main legal provisions of the Law on Competition refer  to:  categories  of  prohibited  anticompetitive  actions  (anticompetitive  agreements,  abuse  of dominant  position,  the  actions  or  inactions  of  public  authorities  and  institutions  preventing  or distorting competition, violations of legal provisions regarding economic concentration, prohibited acts  of  unfair  competition);  procedures  for  investigating  anticompetitive  practices;  merger authorization procedure; conditions for exemption of anti-competitive agreements; determination of sanctions for violations; and conditions of application of the leniency policy.', '3.104.  The Competition Council (CC), previously the National Agency for Protection of Competition (NAPC), was established in 2012 as an autonomous public authority, liable to the Parliament, with the aim to ensure observance of the enforcement of competition and state-aid legislation. It can initiate the examination of any alleged breaches of competition legislation, by its own motion or at the  request  of  any  individual  or  enterprise  affected  by  the  alleged  infringement.  The  CC  is responsible  for  conducting  the  fact-finding  process  and  for  issuing  a  first-instance  ruling.
