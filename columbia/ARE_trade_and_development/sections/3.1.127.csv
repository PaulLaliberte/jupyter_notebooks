The  General  Directorate  of  Customs,  under  the  supervision  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  is responsible for customs procedures in Albania. Organizational changes that have taken place in the Customs Administration since 2010 include the establishment of the Excise Department in August 2012  by  the  entry  into  force  of  the  new  law  ""On  Excises  in  the  Republic  of  Albania""  and  its implementing provisions.1', '3.2.  Albania\'s  main  legislation  governing  customs  issues  includes  the  Customs  Code  and  its implementing  regulations  including  the  Decision  of  the  Council  of  Ministers  (DCM)  No.  205  ""On Implementing  Provisions  of  Customs  Code"".2  A  new  customs  code,  which  is  intended  to  further reflect  the  acquis  communautaire  and  EU  standards  in  the  area  of  customs,  was  adopted  on  31 July 2014 (Law No. 102/2014)3; the Code partially entered into force on 6 September 2014 and on 1 January 2015. Law No. 102/2014 was amended by Law No. 32/2015 of 2 April 2015 ""On some amendments  and  additions  to  the  Law  No.  102/2014"".  This  amendment,  inter  alia,  allows  duty-free shops to be opened at land and maritime borders that are under the Customs\' supervision and control.  The  partial  entry  into  force  of  the  new  code  on  1  January  2015  involved,  inter  alia, provisions  for  authorized  economic  operators,  simplified  procedures,  and  exemption  from  import duties. Where the new code is not yet in force, the previous version of the Customs Code (Law No. 8449 of 27 January 1999) still applies. The authorities envisage that the remaining part of the new code  will  enter  into  force  on  1  June  2017,  at  which  time  the  old  customs  code  will  be  entirely repealed. The authorities consider that the new customs code is in full compliance with, inter alia, Regulation  of  the  European  Parliament  and  Council  No.  952/2013  (9  October  2013)  ""Union Customs Code"", and is partially aligned with some other acts of the EU.

The Administrative Monetary Penalty System (AMPS) grants the CBSA the mandate to impose monetary penalties to commercial clients, for non-compliance with customs legislation and related regulations. The penalty structure is generally graduated, with higher penalties being assessed for repetition  of  same  infractions.  However,  the  penalty  for  a  single  contravention  cannot  exceed Can$25,000. In assessing penalties, the CBSA takes into consideration factors such as the type, the  frequency  and  the  severity  of  the  infraction,  and  the  compliance  history  of  the  client.  Upon receipt of the CBSA's notice of penalty assessment, the client has 90 days to request a correction or  a  review  (appeal).  In  such  case,  the  payment  of  the  penalty  is  deferred  until  a  decision  is rendered. A recourse programme is in place to provide clients with a fair and impartial review of decisions and actions taken by CBSA. In January 2011, an Enhanced Complaint Mechanism (ECM) was  added  to  the  programme  to  track  and  report  on  complaints,  compliments,  comments  or suggestions from clients. Clients that are unsatisfied with the decision may appeal to the Federal Court. There has been no major review to the AMPS since 2011.""]"

This  classification  was  replaced in 2014; enterprises have since been classified, mainly based on their credit rating, as: authorized enterprises,  enterprises  of  general  integrity,  and  ""dishonest""  enterprises.14  Customs  clearance continues to depend upon the enterprise\'s classification and on four other aspects: internal control, financial  status,  compliance  with  rules,  and  trade  security.  Authorized  enterprises,  known  as Authorized  Economic  Operators  (formerly  classified  AA  and  A),  benefit  from  more  simplified customs clearance procedures. Enterprises of general integrity, formerly category B, are subject to intermediate  customs  clearance  procedures,  and  ""dishonest""  enterprises  are  subject  to  stricter controls.15  Enterprises  may  change  category  according  to  their  credit  rating.  Customs  recertifies authorized  enterprises  every  three  years,  and  recertifies  enterprises  of  general  integrity  on  an ad hoc basis.

For  imports,  work  on  the  gradual  implementation  of  a similar computerized system, the SIMP, is under way to enable importers to obtain online the prior authorizations  and  permits  needed  to  import  chemicals,  proprietary  drugs,  cosmetics,  hygiene products and medical inputs, as of October 2016. It is hoped to incorporate all the authorizations from the Ministry of Agriculture by December 2016. For 2017, it is planned to include permits for food  products  in  the  SIMP  through  electronic  exchange  of  data  with  the  Ministry  of  Health's computer system and with the ASYCUDA World system operating in the DGA."", ""3.13.  During  part  of  the period under  review,  El  Salvador  implemented  the  Customs  Programme for  Business  Compliance  (PACE),  introduced  in  2008  as  the  first  step  towards  the  introduction  of the  World  Customs  Organization's  Authorized  Economic  Operator  (AEO)  scheme.  The  PACE  was formally  transferred  to  the  AEO  programme  in  2013.  The  rules  on  implementation  of  the AEO programme  are  currently  available  to  the  export  sector  for  consultation,  although  the programme itself has not yet come into effect."", '3.14.  El Salvador pursued its customs modernization efforts during the review period. In addition to  the  aforementioned  projects,  other  measures  adopted  by  the  DGA  or  being  implemented  in order to facilitate trade and guarantee the logistics chain include: use of non-intrusive equipment at  seven  customs  posts  in  the  country12;  the  installation  of  video  monitoring  equipment;  the introduction of a selection and administration module for risk management; and a new electronic payment  system  (P@GOES).  In  addition,  a  project  has  been  initiated  for  migration  to  the computerized  ASYCUDA  World  customs  system,  which  will  contain  all  information  on  customs operations (including digital certificates) on a single technological platform, allowing the system to be  linked  to  those  of  other  national  and  regional  bodies  involved  in  controlling  foreign  trade operations.  The  authorities  have  indicated  that  the  migration  is  expected  to  be  completed  in August 2016.', '3.15.  As  part  of  the  Central  American  integration  process,  El  Salvador  has  had  ""integrated customs  posts""  (juxtaposed)  along  its  border  with  Guatemala  since  2004.  Under  this  scheme, users  may  complete  the  relevant  formalities  at  the  customs  post  where  the  goods  are  imported, without  having  to  go  also  to  the  export  customs  post,  which  facilitates  and  shortens  the  time required  for  clearance.  Moreover,  El  Salvador  and  Honduras  are  working  on  a  road  map  to establish  a  single  border  post  at  El  Amatillo,  for  which  they  have  requested  international assistance.', '3.16.  Progress  has  also  been  made  on  the  electronic  exchange  of  information  among Central American  customs  authorities  by  means  of  the  telematics  interconnection  system,  which has  a  regional  node  administered  by  the  Secretariat  for  Central  American  Economic  Integration (SIECA) and which acts as administrator for customs in the region. This system is being used for the  electronic  exchange  of  FAUCAs,  for  implementing  the  Mesoamerican  Procedure  for  Goods  in International  Transit  (TIM)  and  operates  on  the  basis  of  a  regional  database  of  carriers.  Work  is also  under  way  on  other  aspects  such  as  the  preparation  of  a  Central  American  single  customs declaration,  the  Authorized  Economic  Operator  scheme  and  a  mechanism  to  prevent  double payment of customs duty under the customs union.', ""3.17.

In  October 2015,  El  Salvador  announced  that  it  would  join  the  efforts  being  made  by Guatemala  and  Honduras  to  promote  the  Central  American  Customs  Union,  which  would  involve the establishment of posts for the free movement of goods among these countries.13', ""3.18.  Despite  the  action  mentioned,  the  passage  of  goods  through  some  of  El  Salvador's  major land  customs  posts  still  faces  problems  of  congestion  and  delays,  partly  owing  to  the  opening hours  and  the  limited  physical  infrastructure  at  these  posts.  According  to  information  from  the World  Bank,  the  time  needed  to  import  goods  into  El  Salvador  rose  from  ten  days  in  2009  to 13 days  in  2015;  of  these  13  days,  three  are  taken  up  by  customs  clearance.  Over  the  same period,  El  Salvador  fell  from  57th  to  73rd  place  (out  of  a  total  of  189  economies)  as  regards  the ease  and  cost  of  completing  import  and  export  formalities.14  On  the  other  hand,  an  OECD  report shows  that  most  of  El  Salvador's  trade  facilitation  indicators  are  the  same  or  exceed  average performance  for  Latin  America.

The EU maintains a system of free zones and warehousing as part of its customs procedures. Free  zones  are  special  areas  designated  within  the  EU  customs  territory  where  import  duties, charges, etc. are not applied until they are formally imported into the territory. With the changes introduced  by  the  UCC,  there  is  now  only  one  type  of  free  zone  that  has  a  physical  boundary supervised by the customs authorities. Not all member States have free zones; as of early 2017, 19  member  States  had  free  zones,  of  which  Croatia,  Lithuania,  and  the  Czech  Republic  had  the most.11 Authorization to set up a free zone rests with the national authorities of the member State concerned. With the changes introduced by the UCC as of 1 May 2016, in accordance with Article 243  of  the  UCC,  type  II  free  zones  do  not  exist  anymore.  The  situation  is  now  equivalent  to  the customs  warehousing  procedure.  As  concerns  warehousing,  the  EU  customs  legislation  has  long provided for public and private customs warehouses. With the introduction of the UCC, the types of warehousing have been simplified and there are now three types: public warehouse type I, public warehouse type II, and private; these generally correlate to the previous designations except for one  (Table  3.1).12  There  are  different  responsibilities  of  the  warehouse  keepers  or  the  traders depending on the type of warehousing arrangement. Like free zones, customs warehousing allows non-EU goods to be stored in a designated warehouse within the customs territory, while not being subject  to  import  duties,  charges,  etc.  The  amount  of  working  or  processing  is  controlled  in warehouses.  Applicants  need  to  provide  a  guarantee,  demonstrate  economic  need,  and  be established in the EU in order to be approved for warehousing.13', ""3.8.  The  EU  has  an  Authorised  Economic  Operator  (AEO)  programme  based  on  the  customs-to-business  partnership  initiative  of  the  WCO.  The  programme  consists  of  two  different  statuses, Authorised  Economic  Operator,  Customs  (AEOC)  for  economic  operators14  authorized  for simplification  of  customs  procedures,  and  Authorised  Economic  Operator,  Security  and  Safety (AEOS),  for  those  entitled  to  facilitations  relating  to  security  and  safety.  An  operator  may  hold both  authorizations  at  the  same  time.  AEOC  status  can  be  granted  to  any  economic  operator established  in  the  EU  territory  who  has  not  committed  any  serious  or  repeated  infringement  of customs or taxation rules, is financially solvent, has appropriate record-keeping, and complies with the  new  criterion  of  proven  practical  or  professional  competence;  an  AEOS  needs  to  comply  also with appropriate security and safety standards. In principle, applications for AEO status should be submitted  to  the  customs  authority  in  the  member  State  where  the  economic  operator's  main accounts  for  customs  purposes  are  kept.  The  benefits  for  traders  can  include  access  to  customs simplifications, fewer controls, priority treatment, prior notification, choice of place of control, etc. In 2015, AEO status was given to more than 14,000 business operators in the EU, accounting for 71%  of  imports.15  The  UCC  also  provides  for  reciprocity  in  granting  the  status  to  economic operators outside the EU who comply with similar legislation of other countries that are recognized by  the  EU.

In  short,  the  CRMF  comprises  identification  and  control  of  high-risk  goods,  identification  of priority control areas, systematic exchange of risk information, contribution of AEO partners, and pre-arrival/pre-departure  security  risk  analysis.18  Since  2014,  the  EU  has  been  working  on  the implementation of its Strategy and Action Plan for Customs Risk Management in order to provide smooth  and  safe  trade  flows  while  ensuring  security  and  safety.19  The  strategy  identifies  key priorities to be achieved through an action plan. The main priorities are: data quality, information sharing,  efficient  controls  and  risk-mitigation,  capacity-building, interagency  cooperation, cooperation with traders, and international customs cooperation.20 Most of the objectives outlined have a gradual phase-in during 2014-20.21', '3.10.

In  2008,  formalities  at  customs exit posts were  abolished  and those  at  entry  posts  were  streamlined  at  all  the  borders  between  the  two  countries.  In  2009, Guatemala  and  El  Salvador  signed  the  protocol  amending  the  framework  agreement  for  the establishment  of  a  customs  union  between  their  countries,  instituting  a transitional  regime  which will conclude with the elimination of customs posts on all the borders between the two countries.

The  two countries  have  been  working  bilaterally  under  this  Protocol  to  move  towards  the  free  transit  of goods and natural persons between them. This is being done in technical bodies that have looked at customs procedures, the criteria for free transit of goods, sanitary procedures, harmonization of tariffs in respect of third countries, and exceptions to free transit. It has also been decided to set up  a  working  group  to  examine  matters  relating  to convergence  of  the  various  preferential  trade agreements  to  which  Guatemala  and  Honduras  belong.  With  the  entry  into  force  of  the  Enabling Protocol, the rules needed for the operation of the customs union will have to be adopted.

Despite  these  efforts,  the  passage  of  goods  through  some  of  Guatemala's  major  land customs posts still faces problems of congestion and delays, partly owing to the opening hours and the  limited  physical  infrastructure  at  the  customs.  This  problem  in  fact  became  worse  in  early 2016, with long queues at the borders. The authorities consider that there are three aspects to this problem:  infrastructure,  procedures  and  personnel.

A major and positive development over the review period was the launch in 2011 of a single electronic  window  (SEW)  system  for  customs  processing  and  clearance  operations.  The  SEW  is used  for  both  import  and  export  operations  and  its  use  is  mandatory.  Apparently  the  SEW  is modelled  on  those  in  operation  in  Ghana  and  Singapore  and  complies  with  international  best practice. It has two main pillars; the Customs Management System (CMS) and TradeNet. The CMS supports customs-related transactions and enables data mining and the generation of statistics.12 TradeNet  is  a  platform  for  electronic  data  interchange  between  various  parties  (border  control agencies,  port  authorities,  freight  forwarders,  customs  brokers,  container  terminal  operators, shipping  agents/lines,  and  commercial  banks).  The  SEW  is  managed  by  the  Mozambique Community  Network  (MCNet),  a  public–private  partnership  in  which  the  Government  has  a  20% share.13  Apparently  the  SEW  cost  around  US$15  million  to  establish14;  its  ongoing  costs  are financed  through  a  network  charge  levied  on  the  customs  declarations  it  processes  (Table  3.1). Risk  profiling  is  built  into  the  SEW,  which  largely  determines  through  which  customs  clearance channel  goods  pass.  There  are  four  channels:  green  (whereby  goods  are  immediately  cleared); blue  (for  use  by  authorized  economic  operators  (see  below));  yellow  (involving  document verification and/or scanning); and red (full documentary and physical inspection).', '3.7.

The  framework  aims  to  raise  the  level  of  proficiency  and professionalism  of  the  declaring  agent  industry.  Under  the  framework,  declaring  agents  are required  to  undergo  an  assessment  by  Singapore  Customs  during  the  registration  process  and subsequent renewals. The assessment covers criteria related to personnel management, training on customs procedures, the company\'s processes and procedures, standard operating procedures, and the company\'s information management and controls. Depending on the performance during the assessment, companies are classified into one of the following five categories, with increasing levels of trade facilitation accorded:  basic, standard, intermediate, enhanced, and premium. The validity  of  the  renewal  period  ranges  from  one  year  (basic  band)  to  three  years.  Furthermore, companies benefit from reduced or a waiver of security requirements as they progress through the different  bands.  For  instance,  premium  band  companies  are  not  required  to  lodge  a  security  for most type of transactions.', '3.4.

Through  the  programme,  supply  chain  stakeholders  are  encouraged  to  adopt  security measures  in  their  trading  operations.  The  programme  provides  for  security  guidelines  that', '\x0cWT/TPR/S/343 • Singapore', '- 26 -', ""stakeholders should achieve in order to enhance the security of their operations. Companies that are  certified  under  the  programme  are  viewed  as  trusted  partners,  and  enjoy  benefits.  For example, companies' cargos considered to be low-risk will be subjected to less frequent customs inspections, and hence there should be time-saving benefits at the border. Companies with high security  standards  in  place  can  be  awarded  the  STP-Plus  certification,  the  highest  tier  of  the accreditation  programme.  Singapore  Customs  has  signed  and  operationalized  mutual  recognition arrangements or agreements (MRAs) with several other customs administrations, thereby mutually recognizing each other's supply chain security programmes and customs controls. The authorities stated that STP-Plus-certified companies are recognized by the trading partner with MRAs as low-risk  at  destination.  Since  its  last  review,  Singapore  has  concluded  MRAs  with:  China  (2012); Chinese Taipei  (2013);  Hong Kong, China  (2014);  and  the  United  States  (2014).4  As  at January 2016,  there  were  72 STP- and  77 STP-Plus-certified  companies,  compared  with  29  and 47 respectively in March 2012. The authorities consider that the programme is consistent with the WCO Framework of Standards to Secure and Facilitate Global Trade (SAFE Framework)."", '3.8.  During  the  review  period,  Singapore  Customs  reformed  its  Licensed  Warehouse  Scheme (LWS). Under the scheme, companies can store imported dutiable goods such as liquor, tobacco, motor vehicles and petroleum for an indefinite period of time in a licensed area with import duties and  goods  and  services  tax  (GST)  suspended.  Starting  in  April  2012,  the  Scheme  has  been restructured to create three tiers of licences: Type I, which is equivalent to the former licence, and Type  II  and  Type  III  where  licensees  are  granted  less  strict  regulatory  controls  and  permit requirements. For instance, Type II licensees pay a single annual licence fee, instead of separate fees,  for  the  storage  of  both  liquor/tobacco  products  and  motor  vehicles.  Type  III  licensees  are allowed  to  store  both  duty-suspended  and  duty-paid  dutiable  goods  within  the  licensed  area,  to operate multiple licensed areas under a single licence, and to pay a single licence fee. The tiered structure  is  also  linked  to  the  integrated  TradeFIRST  assessment  framework:  operators  in  the Premium and Enhanced tiers are granted a Type III licence, while those in the Intermediate and Standard  tiers  are  awarded  Type  II  and  Type  I  licences  respectively  (Table  3.1).  Warehouses licensed  under  the  LWS  or  the  zero-GST  Warehouse  Scheme  can  apply  for  the  Specialised Warehouse  Scheme  (SWS),  a  scheme  introduced  in  2011  to  provide  storage  facilities  for  goods meant for export (Table 3.3).', '3.9.  Singapore has also enhanced its TradeXchange platform by launching new services. Launched in 2007, TradeXchange is an IT platform that is aimed at facilitating the exchange of information within  the  trade  and  logistics  community.5  The  authorities  consider  that,  by  having  the  trading community integrate their trade processes through a single data exchange platform, and pass on documents and information in industry-accepted standardized formats, TradeXchange has reduced the  need  for  multiple  data  entries,  reducing  errors  and  resulting  in  faster  completion  of trade-related  processes.  New  services  introduced  during  the  review  period  include  the TradeXchange  eCO  Preparation  Service,  enabling  the  re-use  of  data  from  approved  permits  to apply for the electronic certificate of origin (eCO); the Permit Report Service, allowing operators to combine shipment details into one single report; and the TradeXchange Repository Service.', '3.10.  Singapore  is  actively  engaged  in  other  trade  facilitation  initiatives  at  the  regional  level, especially  within  the  ASEAN  community.

According to the study, the average time to import, the number of documents required, and the cost of importing were all less than what the Bank had reported in 2015 for Turkey.

In 2013, SACU tariff revenue accounted for  46%  of  its  total  revenue  or  M  6,033  million  (about  US$498  million).  This  amount  fluctuated significantly during the period 2008-15 and reached its lowest value in 2011 (M 2,605 million or US$215 million) as a result of the global crisis and a decline in exports to the SACU area and in particular to South Africa.
