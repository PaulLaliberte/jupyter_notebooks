The development of technical regulations and standards in Barbados is the responsibility of the Barbados National Standards Institution (BNSI). The BNSI is a joint undertaking between the Government of Barbados and the private sector, established de jure in 1973 under the Companies Act, incorporated by private law as a non-profit organization and recognized by the Government. Its General Council is responsible for making policy decisions and comprises representatives from government ministries as well as NGOs and national trade, industrial and professional associations. The General Council is chaired by the Minister of Industry, International Business, Commerce, and Small  Business  Development  who  is  also  President  of  the  BNSI.  The  BNSI  oversees  product standards development, metrology, conformity assessment and certification activities in Barbados.', '3.42.  The  BNSI  was  admitted  to  full  membership  in  ISO  in  1999,  after  having  been  a correspondent member for 26 years. The BNSI is also a member of the Pan-American Standards Commission  (COPANT),  the  CARICOM  Regional  Organisation  for  Standards  and  Quality  (CROSQ) and the Interamerican Metrology System (SIM). It is also a member of the IEC Affiliate Country Programme,  and  a  correspondent  member  of  the  International  Organization  of  Legal  Metrology (OIML).  The  BNSI  is  the  National  Contact  Point  for  Codex  Alimentarius  matters,  as  well  as  the Standards Enquiry Point for Barbados.', '3.43.  Apart  from  the  BNSI,  there  are  two  other  organizations  in  Barbados  charged  by  law  with standards-related  issues  in  specific  fields.  The  Technical,  Vocational,  and  Educational  Training Institute  (TVET)  prepares  guidelines  for  training  institutions  considering  the  skills  that  are necessary  for  various  professions,  and  provides  competence-based  certification  (National Vocational  Qualifications  (NVQs)  and  Caribbean  Vocational  Qualifications  (CVQs).  The  BNSI participates  in  the  approval  of  these  standards:  its  Director  chairs  the  TVET  Standards  Approval', '10 Exceptions to the four-year and 50,000 km maximum criteria are imports from returning nationals', 'provided that they have owned the vehicle for at least four years prior to its importation.

The Government of Barbados notified to the WTO that the BNSI is its enquiry point for all TBT-related  matters.13  It  also  notified  to  the  WTO  in  1997,  its  acceptance  of  the  Code  of  Good Practice  for  the  preparation,  adoption,  and  application  of  standards  and  the  implementation  and administration  of  the  TBT  Agreement  under  Article  15.2.14  The  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  and Foreign  Trade  is  the  notifying  authority.  Barbados  has  not  notified  any  mutual  recognition agreements with third countries.', '3.45.  The  primary  functions  of  the  BNSI  include:  the  drafting  and  implementation  of  standards and technical regulations in all sectors of the economy; the promotion of standardization, quality assurance and simplification in industry and commerce; the certification of products, commodities and processes; and conformity assessment and metrology activities.', '3.46.  The main legislation with respect to standards and technical regulations and regarding the main activities of the BNSI includes: the Standards Act 2006; the Weights and Measures Act, 1977 (Cap  331)  and  its  Regulations  (1985);  the  Control  of  Standards  Regulations  (1982);  and  the Barbados  National  Standards  Institution  (Certification  Marks)  Regulations.  The  latter  two regulations remain in force until replaced by new regulations made under the Standards Act. The authorities  indicated  that  they  are  applied  when  they  do  not  contradict  the  provisions  of  the Standards Act 2006.', '3.47.  There  are  no  sunset  clauses  for  technical  regulations,  but  there  is  a  review  process  for standards.  The  authorities  indicated  that  standards  are  generally  reviewed  every  five  years, although in some cases the review is carried out more frequently.', ""3.48.  The  authorities  have  noted  that  the  BNSI  has,  since  its  inception,  been  amenable  to  the incorporation  of  regional  standards.  The  harmonization  of  regional  standards  by  CARICOM Members is an important step towards the implementation of the CSME. The CARICOM Regional Organisation for Standards and Quality (CROSQ), operational since 2003, is the body charged with harmonizing  regional  standards.  The  CROSQ's  mandate  is  to  establish  and  harmonize  standards and  technical  regulations within  CARICOM,  and  to  promote  the  mutual  recognition  of  conformity assessment procedures covering goods and services produced or provided in CARICOM as well as the  accreditation  and  certification  system  based  on  internationally  accepted  criteria.  CARICOM regional  standards  and  technical  regulations  are  drafted  by  special  CROSQ  committees,  and forwarded  for  adoption  to  the  CROSQ  Council,  which  comprises  the  executive  heads  of  the respective national standards bodies. Standards and technical regulations adopted by the CROSQ are then recommended to COTED for approval. Once approved, national implementation requires that  the  different  CARICOM  governments  adopt  the  necessary  legal  and  administrative arrangements to give effect to the COTED decision.15"", ""3.49.  Barbados  National  Standards  are  prepared  by  the  BNSI,  and  may  include  the  adoption  of standards established by the CROSQ and by any other standards body recognized by the BNSI. In general terms, the development of a standard may take place at the request of an interested party (any  stakeholder,  including  a  member  of  the  BNSI  or  a  Government  agency  or  statutory corporation), or may be self-initiated by the BNSI. The request must be presented in writing; the same procedure applies to request the revision of an existing standard. Barbados must adopt all standards  formulated  at  CARICOM  level,  while  in  the  case  of  other  international  standards, adoption  depends  on  their  nature.  Once  formulated,  the  title  of  the  national  standard  must  be published  in  the  Official  Gazette,  and  in  a  daily  newspaper.  The  BNSI  is  obliged  to  give  due consideration  to  any  resulting  representations  from  the  public.

In  accordance  with  the  Act,  the  Minister  of  Commerce  has  the  faculty,  in  certain  defined circumstances,  to  declare  a  BNSI  standard  compulsory,  that  is,  to  turn  it  into  a  technical regulation. A standard may be declared compulsory for human health or safety reasons; to protect plant  and  animal  health  and  life;  to  ensure  quality;  to  protect  the  economy  of  Barbados;  to prevent  fraud  or  deception;  to  provide  adequate  information  to  the  consumer;  to  safeguard  the public  interest;  and  to  safeguard  the  national  security  of  Barbados.  The  Act  specifies  the procedures  to  be  followed  for  the  adoption  of  the  technical  regulation.  These  include  the publication of a notice in the Official Gazette and in a daily newspaper published in Barbados, and the granting of a period of at least 60 days from the publication of the notice for comments. The notice must also specify the intended date of effect for the technical regulation. The notice does not contain the full text of the proposed regulation.

The St. Vincent and the Grenadines Bureau of Standards (SVGBS) is the national standards body  and  the  enquiry  point  for  standards,  technical  regulations,  certification,  conformity assessment  procedures,  and  metrological  services.34  It  is  responsible  for  the  preparation, adoption, and review of national standards, and the provision of testing and calibration services; it may  also  provide  advice on  quality  control issues.35  The  SVGBS has  accepted  the  Code  of  Good Practice  for  the  Preparation,  Adoption  and  Application  of  Standards  contained  in  Annex  3  to  the TBT Agreement.36 Policy guidelines for the bureau's work are formulated by a National Standards Council, an intergovernmental body with broad stakeholder representation appointed by Cabinet. The  SVGBS  is  a  member  of  the  International  Organization  for  Standardization  (ISO),  the  Pan American  Standards  Commission  (COPANT),  the  CARICOM  Regional  Organization  for  Standards and  Quality  (CROSQ),  and  the  Inter-American  Metrology  System  (CARIMET/SIM).  It  is  also  the national contact point for the Codex Alimentarius Commission."", '3.27.  Proposals for elaboration of a new standard may be made by the general public. National standards  are  prepared  by  technical  committees  within  the  SVGBS  and,  where  applicable,  they replicate or are based on regional and international standards. In principle, the elaboration process includes a three-month period of public consultations, and standards are normally reviewed every five years; however, no specific time frames are stipulated in the national legislation. Authority to declare  a  standard  compulsory  (technical  regulation)  is  vested  in  the  Minister  in  charge  of  the SVGBS  (presently,  the  Minister  of  Agriculture);  typically,  decisions  to  that  effect  are  taken  in consultation with other relevant ministries. Notices of all technical regulations and standards are published in the Government Gazette.', '32 Customs (Control & Management) Act No. 14 of 1999. 33 Customs Duties (Dumping and Subsidies) Act No. 21 of 1958, as amended by Statutory Rules and', 'Orders No. 38 of 1980.', '34 WTO document G/TBT/2/Add.71, 10 December 2002. 35 Standards Act No. 70 of 1992, as amended by Act No. 28 of 2001. 36 WTO document G/TBT/CS/N/150, 9 September 2002.', '\x0cWT/TPR/S/299 • Saint Vincent and the Grenadines', '- 359 -', '3.28.  According  to  the  authorities,  the  primary  purpose  of  technical  regulations  is  to  ensure protection of health and safety, prevention of fraud or deception, and quality maintenance. During the  review  period,  St. Vincent  and  the  Grenadines  notified  13  proposed  technical  regulations  to the WTO;  two  of  which  prescribed  requirements  for  the  labelling  of  pre-packaged  foods.  At end 2013,  there  were  69  standards  and  six  technical  regulations  in  force  in  St.  Vincent  and  the Grenadines;  as  at  the  time  of  the  previous  review,  five  of  the  technical  regulations  concerned labelling  requirements  and  one  was  a  specification  for  tyres.  During  2007-13,  34 new  standards were adopted, of which 27 were adaptations of international standards.', ""3.29.  The importation of goods subject to technical regulations is conditional on presentation of a certificate  of  examination  and  conformity,  issued  by  a  SVGBS-recognized  certifying  body; otherwise  samples  are  taken  for  examination  by  the  SVGBS.  The  producer's  declaration  of conformity  is  generally  accepted  for  the  purpose  of  importation  into  St.  Vincent  and  the Grenadines. Domestic market surveillance for compliance with technical regulations is on the basis of  random  samples;  inspections  at  ports  of  entry  are  carried  out  on  notice  of  suspicious  goods from  the  Customs  and  Excise  Department.  There  are  no  accreditation  procedures  and  no accredited  certifying  bodies  in  St.  Vincent  and  the  Grenadines,  but  the  SVGBS  is  authorized  to certify products and services. Apart from the agreement establishing CROSQ, St. Vincent and the Grenadines  is  not  a  party  to  any  cooperation  or  mutual  recognition  agreements  in  the  area  of technical barriers to trade.""]"
