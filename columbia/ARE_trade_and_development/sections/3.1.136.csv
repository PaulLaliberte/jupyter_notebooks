Cabo Verde nominated the General Directorate of Industry and Energy to serve as its TBT enquiry  point  to  comply  with  the  transparency  obligations  of  the  WTO  Agreement  on  Technical Barriers to Trade, and made a commitment that technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures would not be adopted or implemented until notified to the WTO in compliance with the TBT Agreement.

Ukraine inherited from the Soviet Union a rigid system of technical requirements based on prior  controls  and  widespread  adherence  to  compulsory  standards.  The  process  of  transforming Ukraine\'s  TBT  regime  to  a  WTO-compatible  mixture  of  mandatory  technical  regulations  and standards, by definition voluntary, began during Ukraine\'s process of accession to the WTO. The basic  laws  ""on  standardization""  and  ""on  conformity  assessment""  from  2001  were  supplemented with,  but  not  superseded  by,  Law  No.  3164-IV  ""on  Standards,  Technical  Regulations  and Conformity  Assessment  Procedures""  of  1  December  2005.76  The  three  laws  thus  had  to  be  read together.  The  2005  law  clarified  that  only  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers  had  the  authority  to  adopt technical regulations. The law was amended in 2007 to state that relevant international standards should  be  given  priority  consideration  as  Ukraine  was  developing  its  standards,  technical regulations  and  conformity  assessment  procedures.  In  April  2006,  the  Ukrainian  authorities estimated  that  Ukraine  had  some  3,100  harmonized  national  standards  while  another 8,000 standards remained to be harmonized with international standards. As this task was unlikely to  be  accomplished  prior  to  Ukraine\'s  accession  to  the  WTO,  priority  areas  for  follow-up  were products remaining subject to mandatory certification, cumbersome multiple testing requirements by  different  public  authorities  due  to  overlapping  responsibilities,  accreditation  procedures  for conformity  assessment  bodies  and  the  possibilities  for  mutual  recognition,  the  use  of manufacturers\'  declarations,  and  compliance  with the TBT Agreement.77', 'transparency  obligations  of', 'the', '3.83.

The Law ""on Standardization"" was revised in 2014 to clarify the terminology used, avoid any compulsory application of standards, and to create a national standardization body fully equipped to  promulgate  standards  while  not  being  a  state  authority.78  In  November  2014,  the  Cabinet  of Ministers  designated  the  Ukrainian  Scientific-Research  and  Training  Centre  of  Standardization, Certification and Quality Problems to serve as the new national standardization body.79 Within this body,  an  information  centre  (ISONET)  has  been  established  to  provide  information  about  the institution\'s  work.
