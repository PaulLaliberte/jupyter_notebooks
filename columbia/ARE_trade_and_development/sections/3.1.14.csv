Goods proceeding through customs are subject to fees (emolumentos gerais aduaneiros) for the  customs  services  provided.  These  are  calculated  at  a  rate  of  2%  of  the  c.i.f.  value  upon importation; a reduced rate (0.1%), together with a statistical tax of 0.1%, applies to petroleum products and goods for direct and exclusive use of extractive industries.29 Exports (rate and tax base)  receive  slightly  different  treatment  (Section  3.2.2).  The  entry  into  force  of  the  current customs tariff marked the elimination of all previous exemptions from customs service charges.', '3.33.  In Angola, the marketing of some imported or locally manufactured products is subject to a consumption tax. Depending on the goods, the rates for imports are 2%, 10%, 15%, 20% or 30%', '29 The lists of eligible goods are determined in Law No. 11/04 of 12 November 2004 and Law No. 31/11', 'of 23 September 2011.', '\x0cWT/TPR/S/321 • Angola', '- 42 -', 'of  the  c.i.f.  value  and  are  specified  by  tariff  line  in  the  customs  tariff.30  A  large  number  of goods (89.8% of tariff lines) are subject to the 10% rate. The highest rates mostly apply to certain fish, alcoholic beverages and luxury goods, while the 2% rate applies to certain essential goods, medical  or industrial  use. Duty-free imports are usually also exempt from the consumption tax.31', 'teaching  equipment,  and  some', 'inputs  or  machinery', 'for', '3.34.  The tax base for locally manufactured products is the cost price and the rate applied is the same as that for imported goods. There is no tax on domestically produced unprocessed mining, agricultural, livestock and fisheries products.32 Because of its nature, the consumption tax has a ""knock-on""  effect  that  is  prejudicial  for  productivity  and  consumers.  Moreover,  because  most  of the  goods  marketed  in  Angola  are  imported,  this  tax  reinforces  protection  at  customs  level. The combined  rate  of  customs  duty  and  consumption  tax  can  be  up  to  80%  on  some goods (47 tariff  lines),  including  some  alcoholic  beverages,  tobacco  products,  cosmetics,  leather and articles of jewellery.']"
