The Robinson Patman  Act  (1936)  and  the  Hart-Scott-Rodino  Antitrust  Improvements  Act  (1976)  amended  the Clayton  Act  by  prohibiting  certain  discriminatory  practices  and  by  requiring  detailed  filing  and setting  deadlines  for  the  consummation  of  transactions  in  larger  mergers  and  acquisitions.169  In addition, most States have anti-trust legislation, often modelled on the federal laws.

In relation to international trade, the Webb-Pomerene Export Trade Act may allow associations of otherwise competing businesses to engage in the collective exports of goods provided there are no anticompetitive effects, or injury to competitors, within the United States. The Export Trading Company Act (1982) also creates a procedure whereby persons engaged in export may obtain, under certain circumstances, an export certificate of review providing, inter alia, for limited antitrust immunity.171 The Shipping Act (1984) allows  international  ocean  carriers  to  engage  in  pricing  arrangements  (liner  conferences)  unless these are contested by the Federal Maritime Commission.', '3.179.

Following  the  Supreme  Court's  2013  decision  in  FTC  v.  Actavis  that  reverse-payment pharmaceutical patent settlements are subject to antitrust scrutiny, the FTC submitted an amicus brief  to  the  First  Circuit  Court  of  Appeals  in  a  similar  case,  arguing  that  the  Supreme  Court's Actavis holding applies to non-monetary settlements, which the First Circuit upheld. The FTC also obtained a settlement of its 2008 lawsuit against Cephalon, Inc., which required Cephalon's parent (Teva) to disgorge and return to purchasers US$1.2 billion it had obtained through agreements to pay  four  firms  to  refrain  from  selling  generic  versions  of  its  drug  Provigil.  As  part  of  the  FTC's efforts to police anticompetitive conduct that may raise costs or reduce options for consumers, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit upheld the FTC's determination that McWane, Inc. unlawfully  maintained  its  monopoly  in  the  domestic  pipe  fittings  market  through  exclusionary conduct. In the merger area, in FY2015 the FTC challenged 22 proposed transactions in industries critical to consumers, such as healthcare, pharmaceuticals, hospitals, and retail. In healthcare, the Commission  challenged  transactions  alleging  that  concentrated  provider  markets  tend  to  lead to higher prices and lower quality of care for patients. For example, the FTC achieved an important victory when the Ninth Circuit of Appeals affirmed the district court's decision in St. Luke's Health System v. St. Alphonsus Medical Center that the acquisition had violated the antitrust laws. In the FTC's case against Sysco Corporation and US Foods, the parties abandoned the transaction after the  Commission  sought  an  injunction  in  federal  court  to  prevent  the  acquisition  from  going forward.  In  Staples/Office  Depot, the  parties  abandoned  their  proposed  merger  after  the  district court granted the FTC's request for a preliminary injunction."", '3.183.
