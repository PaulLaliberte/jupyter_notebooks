At the time of WTO accession, the Government committed itself to ensure enforcement of its WTO obligations in its (then) free economic zones, which meant eliminating any requirements for  use  of  local  goods  or  export  performance.  In  addition,  goods  produced  in  these  zones  with imports and imported inputs free of tariffs and certain taxes, would be subject to normal customs formalities when entering the rest of the country's territory, including payment of tariffs and taxes. These basic principles continue to apply to the TIDZs."", ""3.60.  The  TIDZs  were  established  to  provide  favourable  conditions  for  the  development  of business  activities  by  offering  prepared  industrial  sites  with  investor-ready  physical  and  legal infrastructure,  support  services,  and  tax,  customs,  and  other  incentives.  Under  the  Law  on Technological  Industrial  Development  Zones,  the  zones  are  established  to  develop  modern technologies and efficient resource utilization by applying high environmental standards. Changes and  amendments  to  the  law  in  2008,  in  which  the  Commission  for  Protection  of  Competition participated,  provided  consistency  of  the  law  with  State  Aid  Law  requirements.  The  authorities maintain that that the TIDZ Law is fully compatible with EU state aid rules, as confirmed in the European Commission's 2010 Progress Report. The TIDZ Law formally opens the TIDZs to foreign as well as domestic natural and legal persons but in practice TIDZs concentrate mostly on foreign investors, notably an American automotive components producer (Johnson Controls) and another automotive industry supplier (Johnson Matthey).  There are currently nine TIDZs: two in Skopje, and  one  each  in  Tetovo,  Shtip,  Kichevo,  Rankovce,  Strumica,  Prilep,  and  Gevgelija.  Three  are operational for investment: TIDZ Skopje 1, which covers about 140 ha, TIDZ Skopje 2, and TIDZ Shtip (Table 3.9) and more are planned. In 2011, exports from the TIDZs represented 16.2% of total  export  volume  while  in  2012  this  share  is  expected  to  have  risen  to  around  19%  with  a further increase to 24% planned by 2013. According to the authorities, the number of employees in TIDZs is currently slightly more than 2000, up from 634 in 2011. According to the authorities, there  is  no  cost-benefit  analysis  of  the  fiscal  incentives  to  attract  FDI  provided  by  TIDZs  in  a country which already enjoys one of the lowest corporate tax rates in the region."", '\x0cWT/TPR/S/290 • The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia', '- 47 -', 'Table 3.9 Main TIDZs, 2013', 'TIDZ Size  Ownership  Utilizeda  Key investors', 'Infrastructure', 'Skopje 1 139 ha', 'State', 'Ca. 35%', 'Johnson Controls Skopje, Johnson Matthey Vitek Macedonia, Kermet Electronics Macedonia, Prodis SMR Automotive Systems Macedonia  Investment ready', 'Skopje 2 97 ha', 'State', '25%', 'Shtip 206 ha', 'State', '6%', 'Van Hool Macedonia', 'Johnson Controls Shtip', 'Tetovo 97 ha', 'State', '0%', 'None', 'Investment ready', 'Investment ready', 'In 2013 the TIDZ Directorate signed a PPP agreement for development, finance, transfer and operation of TIDZ', 'a  Source:  WTO Secretariat, based on information from DTIDZ online information.

The  Directorate  for  TIDZs,  created  by  the  Law  on  Technological  Industrial  Development Zones,  is  responsible  for  promoting  the  establishment  and  development  of  TIDZs  as  well  as  for regulating  the  users'  operations.  It  also  serves  as  a  one-stop  shop,  issuing  construction  and operational  permits  and  providing  full  after-care  services  to  zone  users.  The  scope  of  the Directorate's  responsibilities  are  stipulated  in  the  Law  on  TIDZs.  The  Government's  aim  is  to attract  enterprises  that  are  mainly  engaged  in  manufacturing,  information  technology,  scientific research,  and  new  technologies,  with  high  environmental  standards.  For  this  purpose,  the following benefits are provided:"", 'Tax:  investors  in  TIDZs  are  entitled  to  ten-year  corporate  income  tax  exemption  (10% thereafter)  and  to  0%  personal  income  tax  (10%  thereafter);  investors  are  exempt  from VAT for supply of goods and services in the TIDZ, except for sales for final consumption, and imports  of  goods  into  the  TIDZ,  provided  goods  are  not  put  into  circulation;  investors  are also  exempt  from  customs  duties  on  imported  inputs  for  re-exported  production  in accordance with domestic customs legislation. The customs duty rate in the zone is 0% for equipment  and  spare  parts  for  equipment  listed  under  tariff  headings  84  to  90.  Raw materials are imported under the regular Customs Law;', 'Land: investors in the TIDZs can negotiate long-term leases for up to 99 years;', 'Infrastructure: exemption from utility taxes on natural gas, water, sewage, and electricity, and free connection to utilities except electricity;', 'Fees and registration: investors are exempt from paying fees for land building permits; fast procedures  for  business  registration  to  further  reduce  start-up  costs.
