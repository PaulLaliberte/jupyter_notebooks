Independence  requirements  for  auditors  still  allow  for  the provision of a range of non-audit services to clients, and, until recently, there was little oversight of  audit  quality  or  independence.  Other  reputational  agents  also  have  limited  requirements  in terms  of  disclosing  or  managing  conflicts  of  interest.  SOEs  are  audited  by  the  Office  of  Auditor General (OAG), a state auditor with limited capabilities to audit statements prepared in accordance with  current  accounting  standards.
