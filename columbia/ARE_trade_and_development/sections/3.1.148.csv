St.  Vincent  and  the  Grenadines  grants  duty-free  access  to  goods  originating  from  other CARICOM countries, in accordance with the relevant rules of origin. The authorities estimate that imports receiving preferential treatment accounted for EC$228.4 million in forgone tariff and tax revenue for the 2008-12 period. Customs duties and other taxes on imports may also be reduced or  waived  under  a  multitude  of  programmes,  which  accounted  for  some  EC$469.1  million  in forgone  revenue  during  2008-12;  forgone  tariff  revenue  represented  approximately  a  third (EC$172 million). A number of tariff concessions target particular groups of economic operators, such as farmers, operators of school buses, and fishing industry stakeholders. Several investment, production,  and  export  promotion  programmes  also  contain  customs  duty  relief  provisions.  The particular focus on inputs under certain schemes de facto enhances tariff escalation, and thereby increases the effective protection of selected economic activities and companies.']"
