Fiji  continues  to  have  various  export  incentive  schemes  with  the  aim  of  increasing investment in exporting activities. The Short-Term Export Profit Deduction Scheme, administered by the Ministry of Finance, exempts from income tax a set share of net profits on exports of goods and  services  (excluding  re-exports)  (Section 21  of  the  Income  Tax  Act).  This  share  has  been reduced gradually from 100% in 2001-02 to 10% in 2015 (as from 2016 export profits will be fully taxed). Revenue forgone from the Scheme increased from F$6 million in 2007 to F$42.4 million in 2014. It was introduced to cushion the impact of the 2001 withdrawal of investment incentives on goods  and  services  to  tax  free  factories  (TFF)  or  firms  located  in  tax  free  zones  (TFZ)  tied  to export  performance  (Section  11,  Fifth  Schedule,  Income  Tax  Act).    However,  because  TFF/TFZ firms  exporting  at  least  70%  of  production  received  duty-free  exemptions  (including  of  VAT)  on imported inputs, and income tax holidays for 13 years, existing beneficiaries will be assisted until 2015.  The  scheme  also  provides  a  full  tax  rebate  on  exports  (excluding  re-exports)  of manufactured,  processed,  and  assembled  goods  (with  at  least  30%  domestic  value  added  or  as otherwise  determined  by  the  Minister),  services,  manufacture  or  produce  of  deep-sea  fishing, production  of  agricultural  products  (excluding  sugar  or  copra,  but  not  their  manufactured derivatives), and timber where export growth over the previous year exceeded F$10,000.30 These schemes  have  been  regularly  notified  to  the  WTO  Committee  on  Subsidies  and  Countervailing Measures. Fiji has been granted extensions, the last until end-2015.31  Exporters also benefit from general investment incentives, such as the 40% investment allowance (section 3.3.1).', '3.68.  In  July  2010,  the  Reserve  Bank  of  Fiji  (RBF)  rationalized  its  Export  Finance  Facility  and Import  Substitution  Facility  into  an  Import  Substitution  and  Export  Finance  Facility  (ISEFF).  In addition,  the  RBF  has  further  reduced  the  administrative  requirements  and  streamlined  the approval  process  for  funding  under  the  scheme.32  The  ISEFF  assists  exporters,  large-scale commercial agricultural farming and renewable energy businesses to obtain credit at concessional interest rates. The export finance part of ISEFF aims to advance competitiveness and ensure the availability  of  credit  to  the  export  sector.  Likewise,  the  import  substitution  component  of  ISEFF aims  to  promote  both  domestic  commercial  agricultural  production  and  the  competitiveness  of local agricultural produce (section 4.1.3).33', '3.69.  The  ISEFF  provides  back-to-back  finance  through  commercial  banks,  licensed  credit institutions (LCIs)34, and the state-owned Fiji Development Bank (FDB). The interest rate charged on  ISEFF  advances  is  currently  2%  per  year.  The  commercial  banks,  LCI  and  FDB,  can  borrow from RBF at this rate and on-lend to businesses with a maximum margin of 5%. The total amount available  for  this  facility  is  F$80  million.  Loans  are  limited  to  a  maximum  of  F$1  million  per business and will be allocated on a first-in basis. Funding is available for the export of all goods by primary  and  secondary  exporters  (primary  exporters  produce/manufacture  while  secondary exporters  act  as  agents  and  distributors  for  their  clients)  and  certain  professional  services  e.g. architectural, engineering and maritime services.35', '30 Export profits on timber were deemed to equal 10% of the f.o.b. value of all ""arms-length"" exports up to  a  maximum  of  50%  of  the  income  arising  from  total  timber  sales.    Exporters  claiming  incentives  are ineligible  for  the  Short-Term  Export  Profit  Deduction  Scheme.    The  Minister  of  Industry,  Trade  and  Tourism could extend the 13-year period by up to 5 years if considered necessary to market the export adequately and to facilitate foreign exchange earnings.', '31 WTO document G/SCM/N/243/FJI, 4 October 2012. 32 Reserve Bank of Fiji (2010), Import Substitution and Export Finance Facility Guidelines, Suva. 33 Investment Fiji online information.

They  must  hold  at  least  5%  of  their  average  deposit  and similar liabilities in outstanding loans to eligible exporters of goods (excluding traditional exports) and  services  (including  construction  and  refurbishment  of  hotels  and  specific  tourist-related operations, as well as architectural, engineering, and maritime services).

It provides pre-shipment export  finance  by  way  of  loans  of  up  to  F$20,000  to  eligible  producers/exporters  (excluding traditional exports of sugar, molasses, gold, green logs, and rough unprocessed sawn timber) at concessionary  interest  rates,  currently  6%  annually.  It  also  allows  eligible  exporters  to  discount export bills as a means of obtaining post-shipment export finance. The Government has allocated F$1.5 million to the facility.', '3.72.  A  duty  drawback  scheme  has  been  in  operation  since  1986  (Section  101,  Customs  Act). FRCA  is  in  charge  of  this  scheme.  There  are  two  types  of  drawback,  depending  on  whether  the imported  goods  are  exported  or  processed.  Normal  drawback  applies  where  imported  inputs  are exported  without  undergoing  any  domestic  processing,  while  industrial  drawback  applies  on imported inputs that undergo processing before export. Exporters must meet several requirements to receive drawback, and the amount of duty refunded is based on a formula derived and agreed between customs and the exporters, which may be company-specific.', '3.73.  The export income deduction rate was increased from 40% during 2012-14 to 50% as from 2015. The deduction is available to all exporters except for re-exports. Export income means net profits  derived  by  a  taxpayer  from  the  business  of  exporting  goods  and  services.  The  export income deduction is only allowed if the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is satisfied that the export earnings will be remitted to Fiji.36', '3.74.  The Duty Suspension Scheme (DSS), introduced in 2002, is used mainly by exporters, and enables  them  to  import  inputs  (raw  materials)  free  of  tariffs  and  VAT  if  they  are  ""substantially transformed"" and exported. New machines and equipment directly used for manufacturing are also free  of  tariffs  (but  VAT  is  payable).  Agriculture  and  mining  are  excluded  from  the  scheme.  The value of duty- and VAT-free imports is the ratio of the share by value of approved imported inputs required  to  produce  the  exports  (the  Entitled  Proportion,  or  EP)  to  the  value  of  exports.  The  EP ratios are product-based. The DSS is administered by the Fiji Export Council, established primarily for this purpose and to improve Fiji\'s export competitiveness.37 Only DSS licensed exporters are eligible for duty suspension.', '3.75.
