Aware  that  cumbersome  transit  procedures  hinder  road-based  trade  and,  hence  economic development,  Ghana  has  modified  several  features  of  its  transit  system  since  its  last  TPR.  As  a result, transit flows have nearly doubled, showing that traders respond rapidly and favourably to appropriate  trade  facilitation  measures  (Chart  3.1).  Since  September  2007,  Customs  has  used transponders to track transit trucks in real time, operated by the GCNeT. Each transit vehicle pays a  fee  for  this  service,  a  cost  that  is  approximately  the  same  as  what  was  formerly  paid  for  the customs  escort,  which  has  been  abolished.  In  addition,  cameras  installed  at  Ghana's  territorial entry and exit points, as well as inland transit check points, verify the integrity of transit vehicles and their loads.8 This reform has reportedly cut the time to process and transport goods crossing the country, thereby significantly lowering transport costs.9"", '3.19.  Goods  in  transit  are  exempt  from  customs  duties.  Guarantee  bonds  are  usually  issued  to ensure that a customs department receives import duties, taxes, and other charges if shipments are  unloaded  unlawfully  during  transit.  Historically,  transit  guarantees  were  granted  by  several agencies in Ghana. But in 2006 the State Insurance Company was granted a monopoly to do so, and  the  formula  for  calculating  the  guarantee  fee  was  changed  from  0.5%  of  the  value  of  the cargo to 0.5% of the taxes and duties that are due.', ""3.20.  The State Insurance Company is now connected to the GCNeT and has real-time access to the  data  needed  to  verify  and  release  transit  guarantees.  Most  transit  bonds  are  now  promptly released,  and  customs  staff  are  being  trained  to  enter  all  information  at  border  crossings.  But these guarantees are currently valid only in Ghana. When leaving Ghana, a transit operator must acquire  a  transit  guarantee  for  the  other  country  requiring  another  bureaucratic  process  and expense. Ghana's guarantee reform was intended to be a first step toward instituting a liberalized"", '6 GICCS online information.

With respect to documentation, the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) is spearheading efforts to initiate the ISRT (section 2.3.3), based on electronic sharing and exchange of the appropriate documentation, and has focused on creating such a system in specific corridors rather than across the WAEMU or ECOWAS. The ISRT convention signed between the authorities of Ghana, Mali, and Burkina Faso in May 2006 still needs to be ratified by Ghana's Parliament.
