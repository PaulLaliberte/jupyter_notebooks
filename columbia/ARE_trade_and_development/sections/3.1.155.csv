EFIC\'s mandate is to  fill  ""gaps""  in  the  provision  of  financial  support  as  these  market  segments  are  not  always comprehensively  serviced  by  Australian  banks  —  in  part  due  to  the  effort  and  complexities involved in banking transactions with smaller clients, in challenging markets, or for unique assets or new technologies.

Although  permitted  by  the  EFIC  Act,  the  EFIC  does  not  normally  provide short-term (less than 360 days) credit insurance due to sufficient private market capacity. Other means of support that are not subject to OECD guidelines include: contract bonds (to buyers to cover  advance  payment,  seller\'s  performance  and  warranty  of  products  sold),  working  capital guarantees (to banks), and political risk insurance (to banks and/or Australian companies investing abroad).139', '136 WTO document WT/TPR/S/244/Rev.1, 18 May 2011.
