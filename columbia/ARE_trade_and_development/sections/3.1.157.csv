Government  trading  enterprises  (GTEs)  remain  engaged,  often  as  monopolies,  in  the production of goods and services; they are required to substantially or fully cover their costs.188 GTEs  established  as  companies  are  subject  to  the  Corporations  Act.  However,  most  GTEs  are established as statutory entities and may have policy objectives that place competing pressures on their  commercial  functions.  All  Australian  government-owned  enterprises  are  subject  to competition  laws.  The  Government\'s  ownership  is  generally  represented  by  two  ""shareholder ministers"",  the  portfolio  minister  (the  Minister  in  charge  of  the  portfolio  in  which  the  GTE  is involved), and the Finance Minister. The Government may impose price controls on GTEs providing goods and services in a monopolistic market, or specify other targets such as community service obligations (CSOs). At present, aside from Australia Post (stamps for letters below 125 grams are regulated) there are no other instances where the Government imposes price controls on GBEs.', ""3.137.  According  to  the  authorities in  2012/13  the  combined  revenue  of  the  eight Commonwealth-owned GBEs accounted for 0.95% of GDP.189 No other recent comprehensive data was  available  (covering  all  government-owned  firms  (including  State-  and  Territory-owned))  to appraise  the  extent  and  impact  of  state  involvement  in  the  economy.  In  2006/07,  there  were 86 GTEs providing essential infrastructure services (section 3.2.8, 3.4.3.1.1 and 3.4.3.1.3) in key sectors of the economy, including water (24), electricity (23), ports (19), forestry (6), rail (6), and urban  transport  (5).190  The  11  largest  GTEs  accounted  for  around  50%  (2006/07)  of  the  total assets  of  these  companies.  These  GTEs  controlled  about  2.8%  (2006/07)  of  Australia's non-household  assets  and  accounted  for  around  1.7%  (2006/07)  of  GDP.  According  to  a  2008 report of the Productivity Commission, the poor financial performance of many GTEs underscored a long-term  failure  to  operate  these  businesses  on  a  fully-commercial  basis,  in  accordance  with competition  policy  (section  3.4.3).  A  number  of  GTEs  relied  heavily  on  government  funding  in order  to  sustain  operations,  and  their  investments  are  funded  from  taxpayers  and  customers. Funding  from  governments  can  be  either  direct,  through  grants,  asset  contributions  or  equity injections, or indirect, via contracts with a GTE or through the provision of loans at below-market interest rates."", '3.138.  During  the  review  period,  the  Commonwealth  Government  privatized  Medibank  Private health  insurance  company  (section  4.5.5.2).  Other  privatizations  were  undertaken  by  the government  of  New  South  Wales  (NSW)  and  involved:  Port  Botany  and  Port  Kembla,  two  of Australia\'s  biggest  ports,  (May  2013);  and  Eraring  Energy  (electricity  generation)  and  two  Delta Electricity power plants (July 2013).191 In July 2013 the government of NSW called for bids in the sale  of  Macquarie  Generation\'s  two  power  plants.  No  further  information  on  main  privatization developments and plans at federal, state, and local level from 2011 onwards were available as no detailed  records  are  maintained  by  the  authorities.  The  2014/15  Budget  provides  for  the  public sector to be streamlined to focus on the areas where Commonwealth Government involvement is necessary.192  By  mid-2014  it  also  proposed  a  $A 5  billion  Asset  Recycling  Fund  to  provide  15% ""bonus""  payments  to  state  governments  that  sell  public  assets  and  use  the  proceeds  to  pay  for so-called ""nation-building infrastructure"" — mainly big privatised road projects.193 The Government intended  to  conduct  reviews  into  future  ownership  options  for  Australian  Hearing,  the  Defence Housing  Authority,  the  Australian  Securities  and  Investments  Commission  Registry  function  and the Royal Australian Mint.', '188 GTEs are also commonly referred to as: government business enterprises (GBEs);', 'government-owned corporations (GOCs); public trading enterprises (PTEs); public corporations; state-owned corporations (SOCs); state-owned enterprises (SOEs); or territory-owned corporations (TOCs) (WTO document WT/TPR/S/244/Rev.1, 18 May 2011).', '189 These GBEs were: ASC Pty Limited, Australian Government Solicitor, Australian Postal Corporation,', 'Australian Rail Track Corporation, Defence Housing Australia, Medibank Private Limited, Moorebank Intermodal Company Limited, and NBN Co Limited.', '190 WTO document WT/TPR/S/244/Rev.1, 18 May 2011. 191 Economist Intelligence Unit (2013).  192 Commonwealth of Australia (2014c), Statement 1: Budget Overview. 193 NewsMail online information, ""Treasurer calls for investors to back infrastructure sales"",', '20 July 2014.
