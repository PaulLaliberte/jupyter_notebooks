Although  it  has  gradually  reduced  its  direct  participation  in  enterprises  through  past divestment and privatization efforts, Malaysia retains large industrial and commercial holdings at federal  and  state  level,  either  directly  through  the  Ministry  of  Finance  Inc.  (the  division  of  the Ministry of Finance overseeing investments) or indirectly through several fully state-owned entities in the form of government-linked corporations (GLCs), government-linked investment companies (GLICs), and statutory bodies.132', '3.103.  GLCs  and  their  controlling  shareholders,  the  seven  GLICs133,  remain  a  significant  part  of the  Malaysian  economy  as  they  have  been  used  to  spearhead  infrastructure  and  industrial projects,  and  constitute  the  main  actors  in  oil  and  gas,  key  strategic  utilities,  and  services including electricity, telecommunications, postal services, airlines, airports, public transport, water and sewerage, banking and financial services.134 GLCs employ an estimated 5% of the workforce, and accounted for approximately 36% and 54%, respectively, of the market capitalization of Bursa Malaysia135  and  the  benchmark  Kuala  Lumpur  Composite  Index.  In  April  2012,  there  were 33 non-financial public enterprises (NFPEs), of which 8 are listed on the Bursa Malaysia, and the Government operated more than 200 industrial estates through its 13 state economic development corporations  (SEDCs).136  The  three  largest  NFPEs  are  PETRONAS  (petroleum),  Tenaga  Nasional (electricity)  and  Telekom  Malaysia  (telecommunications),  which  together  generated  around  two thirds  of  the  estimated  aggregate  NFPE  revenues  of  RM  307.4  billion  in  2011.  Another  30  GLCs listed on the Bursa Malaysia are either financial public enterprises or companies controlled through GLICs; they are involved in, inter alia, automotive, tractors, and building activities.137 The Ministry of  Finance  Inc.  had  partial  or  full  ownership  in  95  companies.  No  data  on  the  production  and trading (domestic sales, imports, exports) activities of all GLCs/SOEs since 2010 were provided by the authorities.', '3.104.  Procurement policies for GLCs and other SOEs seem to be similar to those of ministries and other  government  bodies  although  they  are  not  governed  by  the  same  rules  (section  3.2.6). Procurement  from  local  sources,  including  bumiputera  suppliers  is  encouraged,  with  a  view  to supporting  national  economic  development  (section  2.3138  and  section 3.2.6139).  In  2011,  GLCs gave  bumiputera  companies  RM  81.6  billion  (out  of  RM  159.3  billion)  of  procurement  contracts, through an allegedly merit-based selection process.140 As from 1 January 2012, the date of entry', '131 No information or comments were provided by the authorities on this section. 132 Presentation of the Malaysia Competition Commission on State Owned Enterprises and Competitive', 'Neutrality at the OECD Global Forum on Competition, Session III, Paris, 16-17 February 2012.

During  the  period  under  review,  Malaysia  pursued  its  GLC  Transformation  Program (2005-15) aimed at turning GLCs into stronger and more resilient and competitive companies and into  ""regional  champions"",  without  directly  privatizing  them.  The  programme,  now  in  its  final phase, covers the larger GLC firms (termed as G-20).141 The Government would, inter alia, like to see these companies gradually dispose of their non-core assets and increase collaboration with the private sector.142 In its April 2012 review of the  process, the Putrajaya Committee on  GLC  High Performance noted that the G-20 companies at that time were on a robust growth trajectory while making  further  inroads  in  regional  markets.  Several  GLCs  were  well  on  their  way  to  become regional players and even leaders, such as Axiata Group Berhad, Malayan Banking Berhad, CIMB Group  Holdings  Berhad  and  Sime  Darby  Berhad;  whose  foreign  assets  (as  a  percentage  of  total assets)  grew  from  13%  to  26%  over  the  same  period.143  During  financial  years  2004  to  2011, G-20 foreign sales (as a percentage of total sales) grew from 26% to 33%. G-20 GLCs employed almost  360,000  employees  and  were  a  net  creator  of  16,210  jobs  in  2011.  The  liberalization  of some sectors in Malaysia, the move towards free-trade agreements, and the entry into force of the 2010 Competition Act intensified competition challenges for GLCs.', '3.106.  In  the  context  of  the  2010  NEM  reforms  and  the  10th  Malaysia  Plan,  in  July  2011  the Government  showed  an  increasing  interest  in  restarting  its  privatization  efforts  without  giving specific targets. It listed 33 GLCs as ready for divestment; the plan would be to reduce its stakes in some of these companies, list a few others, and sell the rest.144 These divestment efforts would affect,  inter  alia,  state  companies  such  as  CTRM  Aero  Composites,  Nine  Bio,  Inno  Bio  Ventures, Penang Port, the loss-making Malaysia Airlines, and Proton, the troubled car-maker (section 4.6). Despite discussions on possible strategic partnerships in recent years, none has led to actual deals yet,  as  divestment  or  reform  appear  to  remain  contentious  in  certain  areas  (e.g.  healthcare services). The privatization programme stipulates that bumiputeras should take up at least 30% of equity of a privatized entity, and foreign participation is limited to 25% of share capital, though the  Government  may  grant  waivers.  As  a  prelude  or  an  alternative  to  privatization,  some government  agencies  have  been  corporatized.  The  Malaysian  Industrial  Development  Authority, now  renamed  Malaysian  Investment  Development  Authority,  was  corporatized  in  October  2011, and the corporatization of Radio Televisyen Malaysia (RTM, the state broadcaster) was planned for the second half of 2012.']"
