Separate  registration  is  required  for  each  branch  of  activity. The list  of  activities  is  available  from  MINCOMMERCE.  In  order  to  be  listed  in  this  register, importers  have  to  pay  an  annual  fee  of  CFAF  10,000  (€15)  for  each  separate  activity to the Cameroon  National  Shippers\'  Council  (CNCC,  see  section  4.4.1.3  below)  to  finance its activities.

In  general,  there  have  been  very  few  changes  in  procedures  for  importing  goods  into Cameroon since the previous TPR and they are still costly and burdensome.

By  March  2013,  none  of  these  participants had been linked electronically.', '3.4.  At  the  Customs,  in  March  2013  six  days  were  still  needed  on  average  (a  minimum of three days)  between  the  registration  of  an  import  declaration  (DI)  and  release  of  the  goods. This is an improvement in comparison with the average of 19 days required in May 2007, although considerable progress still has to be  made in comparison with other countries at the same level of development.', '3.5.  Taking  into  account  other  formalities,  notably  those  at  the  port,  the  total  time  taken for clearance is extremely long, particularly between registration of the manifest by the forwarding agent  representing  the  shipper  (for  example,  Maersk)  and  of  the  customs  declaration by the customs  broker.  Demurrage  charges,  payable  as  of  the  eleventh  day  after  registration of the  manifest,  are  a  recurring  problem  for  companies  in  landlocked  countries,  which  depend on the port of Douala and have little control over the length of procedures.', '3.6.

These  contracts  follow  upon  the  ""performance  indicators""  initiated in January 2008, which make the facilities granted conditional upon the performance of importers.

According to the customs authorities,  this  system,  in  effect  in  the  port  of  Douala,  has  helped,  inter  alia,  to  streamline customs controls, reduce the time taken for clearance and the cost of transit through the customs, and has made the nature and level of controls to which shipments are subject according to their risk level more predictable."", '3.7.

A bank guarantee equivalent to the total amount of the duties and taxes payable is required. The Customs needs  20  days  to  regularize  the  bond  for  a  transit  operation.52  According  to  the  Customs,  this geopositioning  system  has  led  to  a  sizeable  increase  in  tax  revenue  as  a  result  of  fewer  false declarations  of  arrival  in  the  country  of  destination.  As  an  important  transit  country,  Cameroon is greatly  affected  by  the  ""false  transit""  phenomenon, fraudulent  putting  up for consumption  of  goods  originally  declared  to  be  in  transit  or  for  export.  According to the customs authorities, this phenomenon causes the State to lose CFAF 100 billion in customs revenue  each  year.  Operators  in  landlocked  countries,  however,  complain  of  delays  of  up  to one week before a lorry is equipped with a GPS beacon.
