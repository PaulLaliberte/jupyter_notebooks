Qatar's tariff schedule, based on the unified customs tariff of the GCC, is not published or available  to  the  public.  Furthermore,  different  country-specific  provisions  or  exceptions  apply, particularly  for  special  and  prohibited  goods  among  the  GCC  member  states.  Thus  the  GCC customs tariff is not applied uniformly. The tariff schedule has one rate of duty, applicable to each tariff line, whether supplied by WTO Member countries or not. The GCC CET includes the HS2012 nomenclature changes, and therefore Qatar applies the 2012 version of the HS. Customs revenues are relatively small, accounting for approximately 1.5% of total government revenues.""]"
