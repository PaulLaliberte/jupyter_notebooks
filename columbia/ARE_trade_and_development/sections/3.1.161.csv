Business  registration  in  Suriname  is  mainly  regulated  through  the  Commercial  Code  of Suriname, which dates back to 1936, as amended; and the Trade Register Law, promulgated in 1936.', ""3.74.  Since  the  last  TPR  of  Suriname,  some  efforts  have  been  made  to  simplify  business registration  requirements.  Since  June 2011,  business  licensing  is  required  for  26 businesses  and professions; all others are subject only to registration in the Chamber of Commerce and Industry's Trade Register."", '3.75.  Licence applicants must be able to prove their creditworthiness. In addition, the Minister in charge of Trade and Industry may determine that, for certain businesses and professions, licences should be granted only if the applicant can furnish satisfactory proof of commercial practice and professional skill. The Minster may issue detailed rules on the manner in which such proof should be  provided.25  A  licence  is  granted  for  a  specific  location,  a  specific  business  or  a  specific profession, for a period of three years. It is renewable for periods of three years, against payment of the same fee paid upon initial application. The Minister may attach conditions to the licence and, if necessary, modify these conditions. The licence is strictly personal and may not be transferred.', '3.76.  In general, the business licensing process remains lengthy and cumbersome.26 Officially, it takes 30 working days for the issue of licences, but in practice it can take months.27 A one-stop window  has  been  established  at  the  Chamber  of  Commerce  and  Industry  with  a  view  to streamlining licensing process for entrepreneurs.', ""3.77.  According to the World Bank, Suriname ranks 164th out of 185 economies on the  ease of starting  a  business.  The  process  requires  an  average  of  13  procedures,  takes  694  days,  costs 115% of income per capita, and requires paid-in minimum capital of 0.5% of income per capita.28 With some 500 days on average, obtaining the President's approval for the company's articles of association is the lengthiest procedure in establishing a limited liability company. The authorities have  indicated  that  the  length  of  this  procedure  has  recently  improved;  however,  no  legal instrument was adopted in that regard."", '24 WTO document, G/SCM/N/186/SUR, 6 May 2009. 25 Specific rules have been promulgated on qualification requirements for architects and engineers, and on standards of creditworthiness, commercial practice, and professional skill in the hotel and tourist industry.', '26 WTO document WT/TPR/S/135, 14 June 2004. 27 U.S. Commercial Services (2010).  28 World Bank (2013).', '\x0cWT/TPR/S/282 • Suriname', '- 38 -']"
