In July 2014, Turkey notified the WTO of its Category A commitments under the Agreement on  Trade  Facilitation.  It  has  designated  all  of  the  provisions  contained  in  Section  I  of  the Agreement  under  Category  A  for  full  implementation  upon  the  Agreement's  entry  into  force, except for Article 7.9 relating to perishable goods.11"", '3.19.  In order to facilitate trade at Turkey\'s terrestrial border posts, the Ministry of Customs and Trade  has  launched  a  ""one  stop  shop""  pilot  project  at  the  Bulgaria-Turkey  land  border  gate  at Kapikule.  According  to  the  authorities,  this  aims  to  reduce  customs  processing  delays  through coordinated  and  synchronized  implementation  of  all  procedures  relating  to  the  provision  of customs services to passengers, vehicles and drivers carrying cargo.', '3.20.  A similar pilot project is due to be implemented at the Georgia-Turkey land border gate of Sarp,  before  being  extended  to  other  relevant  border  gates.  In  accordance  with  the  Agreement between the Government of the Republic of Turkey and the Government of Georgia on the Joint Use  of  the  Land  Customs  Crossing  Points  of  ""Sarp  –  Sarpi""  Cildir/Aktas  -  Kartsakhi""  and ""Posof/Türkgözü – Akhaltsikhe"", the parties have completed all internal procedures for entry into force  of  the  Agreement  and  all  related  protocols,  namely  on  cooperation  and  alignment  of  the procedures  for  the  movement  of  passenger,  vehicles  and  goods  and  working  hours  at  the  land customs  crossing  points  of  ""Sarp  –  Sarpi"",  ""Cildir/Aktaş  –  Kartsakhi""  and  ""Posof/Turkgozu  – Akhaltsikhe"";  on  details  for  electronic  data  exchange  regarding  the  international  movement  of passengers,  vehicles  and  goods;  and  the  technical  provision  document  on  the  data  exchange system.', '3.21.  The Agreement basically aims to render joint services at land customs crossing points of the abovementioned  border  crossing  points  with  a  view  to  ensuring  the  facilitation  of  international traffic  of  passengers,  vehicles  and  goods.  This  project  also  aims  to  avoid  the  duplication  of identical  customs  procedures.  For  example,  declarations  regarding  the  passengers,  vehicles  and goods  shall  only  be  made  in  the  country  of  exit,  and  the  country  of  entry  shall  take  these declarations as a basis. The general information regarding the vehicles and goods lodged at the border  customs  office  of  the  country  of  exit  shall  be  forwarded  electronically  to  the  country  of entry, where its authenticity shall be verified. Technical studies on the exchange of data between the  two  countries  have  been  continuing  and  the  implementation  of  the  project  at  the  border crossing point of ""Sarp – Sarpi"" is to be implemented in 2016.', ""3.22.  Turkey launched an Authorized Economic Operator (AEO) programme in January 2013. The programme's  aim  is  to  facilitate  the  foreign  trade  operations  of  its  traders  by  reducing  required lead times and costs as well as enhancing security by encouraging best practices throughout the supply  chain.  In  order  to  obtain  an  AEO  certificate,  companies  must,  inter  alia,  prove  that  they have traceable documentation, are financially solvent, practice the necessary safety and security measures,  and  are  established  in  Turkey  and  have  been  in  operation  for  at  least  three  years.12 Applications  by  companies  are  made  to  the  regional  customs  and  trade  directorates  with  which they  work.  If  in  order  and  appropriate,  they  are  sent  to  the  Ministry  of  Customs  and  Trade  for assessment  and  an  audit  process  follows.

Local  clearance  means  that  all  the  necessary  customs  transactions  and  controls  (for exports  since  2013  and  for  imports  since  the  beginning  of  2015)  may  be  executed  at  the company's facilities. Having authorized consignor status allows authorized shipping companies to transit their clients' shipments for export without visiting a customs office.13 Authorized consignee status allows shipping companies to complete customs transit transactions for imports at their own facilities or the facilities of companies who hold the right of local clearance. For both authorized consignors and consignees, all necessary controls and sealing activities are also executed at the shipping company's facility or facilities. Other benefits extended to AEO certificate holders are: the use  of  lump-sum  or  partial  guarantees;  the  right  to  self-issue  A.TR  movement  certificates  and EUR.MED  invoice  declarations;  the  ability  to  submit  incomplete  declarations  and  documentation; reduced  data  requirements  for  summary  declarations;  green  line  facilitation;  and  fewer documentary and physical controls as well as control priority.""]"
