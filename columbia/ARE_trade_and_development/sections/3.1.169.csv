Since  its  previous  Review,  Australia  has  continued  to  provide  wide-ranging  assistance  to production,  not  just  in  the  form  of  tariff  concessions  and  other  tax  incentives  (sections  3.2.2.6, 3.3.4, and 3.4.1.3), but also in the form of grants and concessional loans, which are not generally included in its assistance estimates, and regulatory restrictions on competition in certain activities (section  3.4.3.1).  Concessional  loans  are  available  under  the  Clean  Energy  Finance  Corporation, the Export Finance and Insurance Commission, the Farm Finance Concessional Loan Scheme, the Drought  Concessional  Loan  Scheme  and  the  Infrastructure  Growth  Package  programmes (sections 1.2.1, 3.3.5, 4.2.2.2 and 4.3.2 and 4.5.7). Between 2011 and mid-2014 the Department of Industry provided $A 25 million in concessional loans. Assistance generally benefits the industry receiving  it  and,  if  well  targeted  and  designed,  can  deliver  wider  community  benefits,  but  can come  at  a  cost  to  other  industries,  taxpayers,  consumers,  and  competitors.160  There  is  no legislative  requirement  for  conducting  programme  evaluations  in  order  to  assess  their cost-effectiveness  in  achieving  their  stated  objectives.
