Under the Foreign Exchange Act 2006 (Act 723), complemented by operational guidelines, all foreign exchange earned through exports must be surrendered within 60 days of shipment to a registered Ghanaian bank in Ghana, except for cocoa export proceeds which must be surrendered to the BoG. Banks must submit reports of all export receipts to the BoG.', '3.62.  With the exception of cocoa, whose export proceeds must be entirely converted into cedis, exporters may retain a portion of the foreign exchange earned in Foreign Exchange Accounts (FEA) at their local banks (section 1.2). These accounts can be credited with foreign exchange earnings not converted into cedi balances. Residents are allowed to transfer up to US$10,000 per annum from  these  accounts  without  documentation.  Importers  are  also  allowed  to  undertake  imports through direct transfer from FEAs up to US$25,000 per transaction without initial documentation. Subsequently, the importer shall submit the Customs Import Declaration Form no later than three months after the transfer.']"
