All decisions of the Malagasy Government can in principle be appealed before a competent administrative court (see Section 2.1 on legal uncertainty, however). The Customs Code provides for  an  independent  appeals  body  for  operators,  the  Conciliation  and  Customs  Appraisal Commission  (CCED).  In  the  course  of  the  clearance  procedure,  the  declarant  may  challenge, before the Commission, the Customs Administration's decisions concerning the tariff classification, origin  and  value  of  the  declared  goods.15  In  the  second  instance,  the  declarant  may  appeal  the decision  of  the  CCED  to  the  competent  court.  According  to  the  Customs,  the  most  frequent disputes are about value."", '3.26.  In  the  event  of  a  dispute,  the  agent  that  identified  the  infringement  and  his  superiors share 25%  of  the  proceeds  with  the  other  agents  who  participated  in  the  handling  of  the  file (prosecution, recovery, etc.) up to its final settlement.16 According to the Customs, this measure motivates  the  agents  and  encourages  them  to  identify  infringements  rather  than  be  bribed. Provisions  of  this  kind  create  a  conflict  of  interests  between  trade  facilitation  and  the  desire  to multiply the number of dispute cases in order to generate personal income.']"
