In 2009, the Government adopted the Industrial Policy 2009-2020 as a strategic document for  establishing  the  main  policy  directions  for  enhancing  the  competitiveness  of  Macedonian industry.26 According to the strategy, by 2020 the Government plans to develop a dynamic set of sustainable  industries,  including:  organic  wines  and  foods,  eco-steel,  eco-friendly  construction, ICT,  specialized  electronic  parts,  renewable  energy  production,  creative  industries,  medical equipment, and services and tourism.', '3.87.  Industrial policy is a key component in the country\'s structural reform agenda for the period 2012-2014.27 The agenda covers, inter alia, continuous improvement of the business environment; support for entrepreneurship and SMEs as main promoters of economic growth and unemployment reduction; and increased export support and promotion, for the creation of a more export-oriented and  more  competitive  economy.  In  its  2012  progress  report,  the  European  Commission  notes some  progress  in  the  area  of  enterprise  and  industrial  policy,  in  particular  in  improving  the business  environment,  but  it  appears  that  implementation  of  measures  to  further  SME development ""remains scattered across a number of uncoordinated and poorly funded bodies"".28 Without doubt, the business, investment, and trade environment has improved significantly since accession  to  the  WTO  and  the  country  is  seen  as  one  of  the  rapidly  reforming  countries  of  the world.  It  has  also  made  good  progress  with  the  adoption  of  the acquis,  an  important  step  for  a small  landlocked  country  whose  attraction  for  foreign  investors  may  reside  in  its  access  to  the large EU market.', '3.88.  Regarding subsidies, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia confirmed when it acceded to the WTO that it did not maintain subsidies, including export subsidies, within the definition of a prohibited  subsidy  under  Article  3  of  the  Agreement  on  Subsidies  and  Countervailing  Measures (ASCM), and that it would not introduce such prohibited subsidies in the future. In line with the ASCM, the Government has notified to the WTO programmes financed by the state budget.29 The most  recent,  for  the  year  2010,  covers:  (i)  the  textile  industry:  subsidy  of  MDen  1  million,  for market development, commercial infrastructure, technological, and human resource development; (ii) cluster association: subsidy of MDen 2.5 million, to strengthen the leadership of clusters and cluster management; (iii) competitiveness programmes: subsidy of MDen 5.6 million, to increase competitiveness  through  support  to  accelerate  introduction  of  international  standards,  improve innovation  capability,  and  cooperation  with  research  institutions;  (iv)  tourism:  subsidy  of MDen 17 million,  to  support  tour  operators  and  tourism  agencies  offering  complete  tourism package  arrangements  for  visiting  foreign  tourists;  and  (v)  regional  state  aid:  subsidy  of MDen 91 million  (in  the  form  of  grants,  tax  emptions  and  tax  relief),  to  accelerate  regional', '26 Ministry of Economy (2008). 27 Ministry of Finance (2012), p. 58. 28 European Commission (2012), p. 47. 29 WTO document G/SCM/N/220/MKD, 18 June 2012', '\x0cWT/TPR/S/290 • The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia', '- 53 -', 'development supporting production investments and creation of new jobs through investment for users of TIDZs.30']"
