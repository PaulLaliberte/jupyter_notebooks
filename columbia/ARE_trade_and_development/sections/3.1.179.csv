As  per  1  October  2015,  SIPSU  had  registered  114,636  patents  for  inventions, 101,840 patents for utility models, and 30,469 industrial designs. In total, 204,572 certificates had been issued for trademarks and service marks, there were 20 registrations of qualified indications of origin of goods, 26 certificates issued for the right of use of registered qualified indications of origin,  and  13  titles  for  integrated  circuit  topographies.  For  the  monitoring  of  compliance  with protected rights, a special unit (the Division of State Inspectors for Intellectual Property) conducts scheduled and un-scheduled visits of business entities. Depending on the nature of any violations detected, the inspectors may either file administrative offence reports (which are referred to the court  system)  or  notify  a  relevant  pre-trial  investigation  body  of  possible  criminal  offences (Table 3.20).190  Nevertheless,  despite  these  efforts,  the  black  market  for  counterfeit  and  pirated goods  remains  significant  in  Ukraine.

According to the Ukrainian authorities, the 2012 Customs Code improved the protection of intellectual  property  rights  by  incorporating  EU  practices  that  make  it  easier  for  owners  of trademarks, utility models, etc. to protect their rights at the border.192 The State Fiscal Service of Ukraine  maintains  a  register  of  intellectual  property,  listing  some  2,850  registrations  as  per November 2015 and reporting a steady increase in the use of the register. The number of reported cases of suspended customs clearance on suspicion of violation of IP rights rose by 60% in the first half of 2013 compared with the same period of the previous year. During the first nine months of 2015, customs clearance was suspended in 2,070 instances on suspicion of violation of intellectual property  rights,  resulting  either  in  the  destruction  of  goods  or  further  investigation.  Nearly 700 criminal proceedings were initiated, resulting in 101 indictments during the same period. The detection of clandestine production sites led to the seizure of counterfeit goods worth an estimated US$54 million.', '3.154.  A United States-Ukraine IPR Action Plan was formalized in 2010. The plan addressed the passage of legislation, enforcement, enhancement of public awareness, violation of protected data, pharmaceutical patents, and the use of unlicensed software in public administration. In 2013, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) designated Ukraine a ""Priority Foreign Country"" in its Special  301  Report,  signalling  significant  problems  in  the  area  of  intellectual  property  rights enforcement.193  Issues  of  particular  concern  were  (i)  the  administration  of  collection  societies, a', '190 Investigation of alleged criminal activity in the area of intellectual property may fall within the', 'responsibility of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Security Service, the State Fiscal Service, or the Antimonopoly Committee of Ukraine.', '191 International Chamber of Commerce (BASCAP).

It is nevertheless acknowledged that cybercrime and cybersecurity represent a complicated challenge for Ukrainian officials.', '3.155.  Ukraine  has  for  many  years  looked  towards  the  European  Union  for  the  development  of legislation in the area of intellectual property. A ""National Program of Adaptation of the National Legislation to the EU Legislation"", adopted in 2004, identified intellectual property as one of the priority areas for harmonization with the acquis communautaire. EU legislation thus usually served as a model as Ukraine sought to meet the requirements of the TRIPS Agreement during 2004 to 2008. Since then, a draft law amending provisions on copyright and related rights was developed further to the national programme and presented to the Verkhovna Rada in February 2011.196 The bill passed in the first reading, but was not included for the second reading in April 2013, and was therefore considered rejected. Another draft law amending IP provisions was in principle adopted in 2010 and further refined by the Committee on Science and Education of the Verkhovna Rada.197 However, the bill was not included in the agenda of the Verkhovna Rada in April 2014, and was therefore  also  considered  rejected.198  Subsequently,  the  State  Intellectual  Property  Service  has developed a new draft law ""on Amendments to Certain Legislative Acts of Ukraine on Regulation of Copyright  and  Related  Rights  Issues""  which,  with  due  regard  to  the  implementation  of  the Association  Agreement  with  the  EU,  gives  consideration  to  the  provisions  of  six  related EU Directives.199', ""3.156.

In the area of geographical indications, Ukraine has  committed  itself  to  provide  a  higher  level  of  protection  than  required  under  the  TRIPS Agreement.
