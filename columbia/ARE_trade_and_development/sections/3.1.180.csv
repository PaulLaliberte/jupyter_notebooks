Madagascar has a simple import tax structure, with the customs tariff being the only duty levied exclusively on imports. Yet several levies are still being collected at the Malagasy border at importation  and  to  a  lesser  extent  at  exportation,  in  particular  through  internal  taxes (Section 3.1.4.4  below)  and  fees,  dues  or  other  charges  assessed  when  goods  arrive  at  ports (Section 4.7.1).', '3.28.  The  rates  of  the  tariff  and  other  duties  are  modified  each  year  by  the  Finance  Law. Since 2008,  customs  duty  modifications  have  been  mostly  downward  and  have  affected  mainly inputs for agricultural production (Section 4.1.1.1).17 Besides, the payment of petroleum taxes has been  partly  deferred  since  2011,  on  the  one  hand  as  a  State  guarantee  of  the  payment  of government subsidies granted to distributors of oil products, and on the other, of the payment of JIRAMA electricity company debts to distributors (Section 4.5.2).', '3.29.  Between  2008  and  2014,  customs  revenues  have  accordingly  declined  in  proportion to the value  of  imports,  to  less  than  5%  of  the  latter.  Internal  taxes  collected  on  imports, including 20% VAT, have also fallen. Total taxes levied on imports, which were more than 30% of their  value  in  2012,  have  fallen  to  23%.  Yet  these  taxes  continue  to  occupy  a  disproportionate place in the government budget, a fact that is thwarting attempts to eliminate international trade taxes: these levies at the border account for 52.5% of tax revenue.
