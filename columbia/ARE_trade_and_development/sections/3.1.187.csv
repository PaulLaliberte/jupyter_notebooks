An  Intellectual  Property  Development  Plan  (IPDP)  was  established  in  2009  with  the assistance  of  WIPO.  Among  its  recommendations  are:  (a)  the  implementation  of  a  national  IP policy and establishment of a national policy forum to include stakeholders from both public and private sectors; (b) the establishment of a coordinating mechanism through an IP Council; (c) the establishment of a single IP Office based on international best practice; and (d) the revision of IP laws to ensure compliance with the latest IP developments at the international levels.', '3.111.

Key objectives are to: (a) be compliant with the WIPO Copyright  Treaty  (WCT)  and  WIPO  Performances  and  Phonograms  Treaty  (WPPT);  (b)  address issues  related  to  the  internet  and  piracy;  (c)  provide  for  protection  to  performers,  producers  of phonograms and broadcasting organizations, and computer software and databases, in addition to the  current  protection  afforded  to  the  authors  of  artistic,  literary  or  scientific  work  or  of  a derivative work; (d) provide for limitations and exceptions in specific circumstances; (e) review the role and functions of the Mauritius Society of Authors (MASA); (f) provide for quick remedies to copyright  holders  in  cases  of  infringements;  (g)  provide  for  anti-circumvention  measures  and make provisions for ephemeral recordings; and (h) provide for adaptation of works in line with the', '87 Consumer Protection (Maximum Recommended Retail Price) (Code of Practice) Regulations 2008 (as', 'amended).

It has also added certain articles to the single text of the Penal Code.

In an effort to improve service delivery and ensure effective administration of business and intellectual  property  rights  (IPRs)  registration,  the  Business  and  Intellectual  Property  Authority (BIPA) has been established under the auspices of the MITSD. BIPA serves as a one-stop centre for  all  business  and  IPR  registrations  and  related  matters.  BIPA  is  currently  established  under section 21 of the Companies Act, pending the enactment of the enabling legislation to transform it into a fully-fledged regulatory body. The functions of BIPA are: to be the central focal point for the registration, administration and protection of businesses, and commercial and industrial property rights; and to be the legal depository of the information, documents and data that must be lodged under the applicable legislations. BIPA will further be tasked with the provision of general advisory services and the dissemination of information on business registration and IPRs.', '3.106.
