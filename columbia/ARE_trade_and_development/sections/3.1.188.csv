The natural resource endowments in the oil-rich UAE have decisively impacted the level of state  ownership  there.  The  oil  industry,  however,  is  not  the  only  sector  characterized  by  state dominance. State ownership encompasses nearly all other productive activities such as real estate, telecommunications,  construction,  manufacturing,  electricity,  transport,  agribusiness,  education, and health services. In 2009, the Government established the Emirates Competitiveness Council (ECC)  to  address  issues  related  to  improving  the  efficiency  and  governance  of  state-owned enterprises,  recognizing  that  some  of  them  are  a  fiscal  burden  while  others  are,  or  could  be,  a source of economic competitiveness. The ECC's other objectives include engaging with the private sector  to  identify  and  communicate  its  needs  for  improving  competitiveness.  The  Dubai Government has also taken various measures since 2009 to improve the corporate governance in GREs. Many of these GREs are either listed or have been regular issuers of bonds and sukuks in the  capital  markets  (DEWA,  Emirates,  Emaar,  DP  World,  Nakheel,  and  JAFZA  to  name  a  few). These entities, as part of their investor relations, regularly disclose their financials, which include debt levels and asset positions, to lenders and bond holders."", '3.75.  Some  GREs,  such  as  Emirates  National  Oil  Company  (ENOC),  are  strategically  important companies  and  important  sources  of  fiscal  revenue.  In  2006,  Mubadala  Development  Company established Masdar to develop renewable energy and sustainable technology industries. A number of GREs, such as Emirates Airlines and Etisalat, have in recent years emerged as internationally recognized brands. Some, but not all of these companies, operate in the same sectors and may compete  against  other  state-owned  firms  (Emirates,  Etihad  and  Fly  Dubai  in  air  transport  or Etisalat  and  Du  in  telecommunications).  According  to  the  authorities,  in  many  cases  these companies,  although  state-owned,  have  full  autonomy  and  are  managed  independently  through their boards. In Dubai, GREs have been used as an engine for diversification and are present in a number of sectors, including construction, hospitality, transport, banking and telecommunications.', '3.76.  In 2012 the Central Bank required local financial institutions to limit their exposure to the Governments of the emirates in the federation and related entities to a maximum of 100% of their capital base, and their exposure to individual public sector borrowers to 25%. This measure was adopted as a reaction to the financial crisis, during which several GREs defaulted on loans, creating liquidity  problems  in  the  local  banking  market.  In  October  2012,  the  Government  of  Abu  Dhabi issued a new decree requiring SOEs to apply for an explicit sovereign guarantee prior to issuing debt.  Sectoral  regulations  also  in  some  cases  address  governance  structures  and  practices  of GREs.

However,  total  government  and  GRE  debt  in  Dubai  continued  to  be  significant  at 136%  of  Dubai  GDP.  In  Abu  Dhabi  GREs  have  substantially  reduced  their  debt.37  Furthermore, according to the authorities, as a result of the measures taken since the financial crises the GREs are in a comfortable liquidity position because they have deleveraged their balance sheets through sales  of  non-core  assets,  raising  fresh  equity  and  long-term  fixed  rate  debts  in  the  bond  and lending markets.', ""3.78.  The authorities also stated that the commercial debt of state-owned companies should be distinguished  from  sovereign  government  debt.  The  Government's  intervention  in  2009  to restructure some of the debt of these companies and facilitate deferred payments was without any public guarantee or commitments. Furthermore, Law No. 3 of 2006 which established Dubai World, states  that  the  entity  has  an  independent  legal  status  and  is  managed  on  a  commercial  basis (Article 3) while the Government is not responsible for its debts (Article 15).""]"
