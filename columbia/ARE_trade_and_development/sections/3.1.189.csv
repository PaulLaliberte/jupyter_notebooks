Industrial  parks  (Section  4.5)  are  an  important  component  of  Haiti's  strategy  to  conquer export  markets.  Originally,  the  aim  was  to  receive  export-  or  re-export-oriented  companies. This strategy was reinforced by the adoption of the LZF.35 The Government's policy on free zones is  intended  to  facilitate  investment,  create  stable  jobs  and  secure  the  transfer  of  technology  to domestic industry. The LZF sets out the criteria for the creation of free zones and the fiscal and customs regime applicable to them. The implementing measures were adopted in 2012.36"", '3.80.  The  LZF  defines  two  types  of  free  zones:  private  free  zones  and  mixed  free  zones  set  up under  a  public-private  partnership.  Free  zone  status  may  be  accorded  to  any  natural  or  legal person  recognized  as  having  a  good  moral  and  professional  reputation  and  as  being  entirely financially solvent in the country of origin or in the country(ies) of operation over the previous five years. The fees for initiating the procedure are G 300,000 and are not reimbursable. Three types of  activity  may  be  conducted  in  free  zones:  industrial  activities;  business  activities;  general services (i.e. any international trade-related service activity).', '3.81.  Free  zone  status  may  be  granted  to  any  business  exporting  at  least  70%  of  its  output. Businesses  set  up  in  free  zones  (and  their  promoters)  are  eligible  for  the  benefits  defined  in the Investment Code (Section 3.3.1). The legislation also makes provision for benefits specific to free  zones.  For  example,  investment  in  free  zones  or  free  enterprises  is  given  ten years  total exemption for the income earned from the investment and the sums invested in a free zone may be deducted from tax. The investment must, however, be retained for at least five years.', '3.82.  Goods produced or assembled in free zones may obtain supplies from the domestic market for up to 30% of their total output (during any particular quarter) and after paying the customs duty and taxes applicable. Businesses providing a certain number of services deemed to be special may reserve up to 30% of their turnover (or capacity) for local clients over any particular quarter. This  concerns  suppliers  of  services  such  as:  tourism  services;  clinics  or  specialized  hospitals; retirement  homes;  detoxification  centres;  and  spa  residences.  The  same  applies  to  businesses providing financial, scientific or tourism services.37', ""3.83.  The  National  Free  Zones  Council  (CNZF)  is  the  institution  responsible  for  implementing the LZF.  Its  task  is  to  examine  applications  for  admission  to  free  zone  status,  to  ensure  that approved  projects  are  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  terms,  and  to  regulate  free  zones. It is composed of representatives of the principal government authorities involved in implementing the LZF,  together  with  two  representatives  from  the  private  sector.  These  are  selected  by the Government from a list of ten persons nominated by employers' and cooperative associations and  trade  unions.  The  CNZF  has  the  authority  to  examine  and  approve  or  reject  candidatures. A free zone concession is usually granted by means of an order adopted by the Council of Ministers and published in the official journal Le Moniteur and is valid for a renewable term of 25 years."", '3.84.  The  management  and  regulation  of  free  zones  are  the  responsibility  of  the  Free  Zones Directorate,  under  the  authority  of  the  MCI.  It  is  the  body  responsible  for  regulation  and coordination  as  regards  the  development,  exploitation,  operation,  management,  maintenance and promotion of free zones.']"
