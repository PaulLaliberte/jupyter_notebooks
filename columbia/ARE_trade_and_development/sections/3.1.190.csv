The  Central  African  Republic  has  no  national  regulatory  framework  on  standardization and quality management, and no notification has been made to the WTO on the matter. The only law on standardization and quality control is currently being adopted. The commission on texts has already  reviewed  and  validated  the  draft  law.  There  had  previously  been  no  State  entity responsible for implementing Government policy on standardization. Since 2005, an organic text has  made  it  possible  to  task  the  Ministry  of  Trade  and  Industry  with  implementing  this  policy. A standards  and  quality  division  was  created  for  that  purpose  within  the  Ministry  and  more precisely  within  the  Directorate-General  of  Industry.  The  SPS  notification  authority  as  well as the SPS  enquiry  point  have  just  been  designated.  The  notification  to  the  WTO  will  soon be possible. The only certification done by the Central African Republic is that of products made by ORCCPA  (coffee).  The  country  has  no  national  standards.  The  only  institution  authorized to adopt  international  standards  and  formulate  national  standards  is  currently  being  created (Central African Agency for Standardization envisaged in the draft law now being adopted).', '3.45.  The  other  quality  infrastructure  components  (standardization,  conformity  assessment, certification and accreditation) are taken into account by the European Union within the framework of  the  CEMAC  quality  programme.  In  the  CAR,  in  the  absence  of  national  rules,  imports  must be accompanied by a certificate of conformity with international standards. The certificate is issued by the BIVAC inspection company.', '3.46.  The  customs  and  trade  checkpoints  are  responsible  for  the  enforcement  of  import regulations. Products quality controls are carried out by local laboratories to be sure of compliance with the standards.', '3.47.  The  Central  African  Republic  is  not  a  member  of  the  International  Organization for Standardization (ISO). The CAR had been subscriber member of the ISO from 2010 to 2012. That  membership  was  terminated  at  the  end  of  2012.  Moves  are  afoot  for  rehabilitation.  When needed, it utilizes the standards laid down by the Association française de normalisation (AFNOR).']"
