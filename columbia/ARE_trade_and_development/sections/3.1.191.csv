There is no overarching legal framework governing incentives and subsidies in Canada. The government generally aims to create a competitive investment climate through its broad economic policies  (e.g.  sound  fiscal  policy,  stable  financial  sector,  low  corporate  tax  rates).  There  are  a number of incentives offered to businesses, including government grants and financing, tax credits and incentives, and wage subsidies by federal or provincial governments. According to a study by the  Fraser  Institute,  and  based  on  data  from  Statistics  Canada  spanning  from  1981  to  2009 (fiscal years), federal, provincial, and municipal subsidies to private sector business, government business  enterprises,  and  consumers  amounted  to  1.5%  of  GDP  in  2009,  with  a  cost  to  each taxpayer who filed and paid taxes of Can$1,507. The Fraser Institute also looked at a second data set from the federal department of Industry Canada and noted that between 1961 and 2013, this department  disbursed  Can$22.4  billion  to  private  sector  business  and  the  top  10  recipients (e.g. Pratt  &  Whitney  Canada,  Bombardier,  CAE Inc.,  and  General  Motors  of  Canada)  received Can$8.5 billion, or 38% of all money disbursed.89', '3.115.  According  to  Canada  Business  Network,  a  government  information  service  for  business, there are some 755 support programmes providing assistance to businesses in the form of grants, loan guarantees, tax refunds and credits, and wage subsidies. Many are at the provincial level and thus,  restricted  to  recipients  established  in  the  province.  Others  are  sector  specific,  such  as agriculture and cultural industries. An overview of the programmes listed indicates that most are specifically targeted to a particular sector or location and that many programmes offered were with respect  to  grants  or  contributions.  It  was  not  possible  to  determine  the  total  amount  of  aid provided under each programme or category (Table 3.15).90', 'Table 3.15 Government Financing Programmes Listed by Canada Business Network, December 2014 Financing type Grants, contributions, and financial assistance Loans and cash advances Loan guarantees Tax refunds and credits Wage subsidies Equity investments Financing for innovation Source:  Viewed at: http://www.canadabusiness.ca/eng/page/2848/.', '238 114 27 71 76 24 159', 'Number of programmes', '3.116.  Industry Canada maintains three special financing programmes: two for the Aerospace and Defence  industry,  known  as  the  Strategic  Aerospace  and  Defence  Initiative  (SADI)  and  the Technology  Demonstration  Program  (TPD);  and  another  one  for  small  businesses,  known  as  the Canada  Small  Business  Financing  Program  (CSBFP).

The  total  amount  of  SADI  funding  is  set  at approximately Can$200 million per year. The Technology Demonstration Program (TDP) provides contributions  in  support  of  large-scale  technology  demonstration  projects  in  the  aerospace, defence,  space  and  security  sectors.  Demonstration  projects,  led  by  an  Original  Equipment Manufacturer  (OEM)  or  a  Tier  1  company,  require  the  integration  of  many  technologies  and  the coordination  of  activities  and  resources  from  multiple  project  members.  The  TDP  may  award  a non-repayable  contribution  to  support  one  large  scale  project  per  year,  up  to  a  maximum  of Can$54  million.  The  programme  will  cover  up  to  50%  of  total  eligible  project  costs  over  the multi-year life of the project. The CSBFP helps small businesses with loans to obtain fixed asset financing in conjunction with financial institutions. The programme has been in operation for over 50 years  with  the  objective  of  helping  new  businesses  get  established  and  enabling  established businesses  to  expand.

The  Business  Development  Bank  of  Canada,  a  federal  crown  corporation  reporting  to Industry  Canada,  provides  financing  and  other  services  to  businesses,  in  particular,  SMEs,  to promote investment in and development of Canadian businesses. The Business Development Bank of Canada provides venture capital, subordinate financing, business loans, and working capital; it also  often  provides  financing  for  businesses  whose  needs  exceed  that  of  traditional  financing through flexible repayment terms. During the review period, the level of the financing activities of the  bank  gradually  increased,  and  financing  constituted  the  majority  of  its  activities,  supporting losses in the venture capital and consulting sectors (Table 3.16).', 'Table  3.16  Activities  of  the  Business  Development  Bank  of  Canada,  by  net  income, 2011-14  Financing Subordinate financing Venture capital Consulting Securitization Venture capital action plan', '2014 433.8 23.3 (12) (16.9) 5.8 (1.4)', '2013 433.1 34.7 (8,6) (12.4) 11.4 --', '2011 305.6 20.4 (20.8) (8.9) 70.2 --', '2012 504.7 36.2 (42.7) (11) 46.2 --', 'Source:  Business Development Bank of Canada, Annual Report 2014.', ""3.118.  Other federal Departments have various funding or incentive programmes, many of which are  available  to  private  businesses,  but  also  to individuals,  organisations,  sub-federal governments,  the  non-profit  sector,  etc.  Many  of  these  programmes  are  reflected  in  Canada's subsidies notification to the WTO (Table 3.17)."", '3.119.  During the review period, Canada made two notifications to the WTO, in 2011 and 2013 respectively, pursuant to Article XVI:1 of GATT 1994 and Article 25 of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. According to these notifications, the number of subsidy programmes increased  from  87  to  112  from  the  2011  compared  to  the  2013  notification,  but  their  value decreased. The programmes are almost equally distributed between the federal and the provincial level,  with  58  being  reported  at  the  federal  level  and  54  at  the  provincial  level  in  2013.
