The Customs Inspection Department draws up the risk management plans, which may vary  from  one  customs  post  to  another;  their  purpose  is  to  reinforce  customs  inspection  at  the busiest  posts  in  Chile  where  the  risk  is  greatest.  Border  inspection  has  improved  following implementation  of  these  plans.  For  example,  thanks  to  the  efforts  made  to  combat  cigarette smuggling, in 2013 462,004 cartons were seized, a 99% increase over the previous year (2012). If these  cigarettes  had  been  sold  legally  on  the  domestic  market,  US$18 million  more  in  duty would have been collected. In 2014, the number of cartons seized again rose (552,120 cartons) and the duty foregone amounted to US$22 million. The plan for controlling the drugs traffic also showed  satisfactory  results  in  2013,  when  3,736  tonnes  of  illicit  substances  were  seized, a 25% increase compared to 2012. This was owing to improvements in the analysis and planning procedures  among  the  various  customs  posts  in  Chile  and  the  utilization  of  non-invasive technology such as X-ray machines. The aim of the Integrated Value Plan, which has been in force for over a decade, is to lessen tax evasion in import transactions by identifying the risks associated with under-valuation, and to draw up procedures to verify the prices declared by the companies concerned,  and  in  2013  it  resulted  in  some  US$5 million  being  collected,  a  16%  increase over 2012.12', '3.9.  Chile has made progress in drawing up a risk management model based on the conduct of operators  involved  in  trade.  To  do  so,  it  started  to  design  a  model  for  classifying  importers, exporters, customs agents and warehouse operators which allows them to be effectively controlled and is based on selectivity criteria (for example, complaints made by the Customs or customs fines not  paid).  In  2014,  this  model  was  further  developed  by  incorporating  new  variables and information.13', ""3.10.  During the period under review, a number of legal amendments were introduced in order to give  due  procedural  guarantees  and  these  have  had  a  noticeable  impact  on  the  procedures  for appealing against decisions by the National Customs Service; a judicial body has been set up in Chile, separate from the Customs authority, to deal with any claims. Until 2009, appeals against decisions by the National Customs Service could be made in the first instance to a regional director or the administrator of the respective Customs, and a further appeal could be made to the National Director of Customs against the latter's decision; the Director's ruling was final and applied to all the Customs in Chile.14 Pursuant to Law No. 20.322 of 27 January 2009, which strengthened and improved  the  tax  and  customs  justice  system,  Tax  and  Customs  Courts  (TTA)  were  created  as independent judicial bodies to hear disputes that might arise in the various territorial jurisdictions. Appeals against decisions by the TTAs can be made to the Court of Appeal in the second instance. In 2014, 18 TTAs were functioning.15 Importers may present two types of appeal: (1) an appeal for  review  if  there  is  disagreement  with  a  decision  by  the  Customs,  and  (2)  a  special  appeal claiming violation of rights when a person considers that his rights have been violated as a result of an act or omission by the Customs. The Law also allows for the possibility of making an appeal directly to the Customs in the first instance, although such a procedure is not mandatory, or an appeal  may  be  made  directly  to  the  Tribunals.  During  the  review  period,  the  National  Customs Service also dealt with 4,318 pending cases that had been submitted under the appeals procedure in effect prior to the creation of the TTAs."", '3.11.

Customs entries may be submitted electronically but at least three hard copies of the entry forms (C100) must also be presented with the relevant commercial invoices, air waybill/bill of lading, and a worksheet on the classification and value of the goods. An importer's declaration form may be required if the invoice is unsigned or deemed insufficient by Customs. Customs entries are verified to ensure that the items are properly classified, the value for duty purposes is correct, the relevant duties and taxes are accurately computed and that any other regulatory requirement is complied with.  The  entry  is  then  finalized  by  Customs  and  an  Assessment  Notice  is  generated  with  the details of the customs duty to be paid. After payment of the duties and the charges due to the Port Authority, Customs issues a document authorizing the release of the goods. Goods may be allowed entry  even  if  the  relevant  import  documents  are  not  ready,  provided  a  surety  is  made  and  the documents  are  presented  within  a  week.
