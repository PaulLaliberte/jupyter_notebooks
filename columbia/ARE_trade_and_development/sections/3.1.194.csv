State involvement in the economy persists. The current 56 state-owned enterprises (SOEs) can  be  grouped  into  nine  broad  sectors:  agriculture,  natural  resources,  public  utilities,  energy, telecommunications,  transportation,  social  and  technology,  industrial  and  commerce,  and, specialized financial institutions (SFI) (Table 3.6). With total assets of B 12.3 trillion and more than 210,000 staff  employed,  the  SOEs  generated  total  revenue  and  net  profit  of  B  4.1  trillion  and B 230 billion in 2014, respectively; the net profit accounted for about 1.9% of their assets.133 The SOEs total expenditure stood at B 3.7 trillion or 42% of the GDP. Consequently, their performance and  efficiency  are  very  low  and  they  spend  more  annually  on  investment  than  the  Government does.134  Thailand's  listed  public  companies  and  their  subsidiaries  account  for  a  fifth  of  the  local stock-market capitalization, and their revenues are a source of financing for government projects. There are currently 5 out of 56 SOEs that are listed in the Stock Exchange of Thailand which are PTT  Public  Company  Limited,  Krung  Thai  Bank  Public  Company  Limited,  MCOT  Public  Company Limited,  Airports  of  Thailand  Public  Company  Limited,  and  Thai  Airways  International  Public Company Limited. In FY2014 the operations of some of these SOEs resulted in losses estimated at B 33.8 billion or 0.3% of GDP.135 According to the 2014 Budget, in FY 2014 Central Government income from SOEs accounted for B 116 billion or 4.6% (6.2% in FY 2012) of the estimated total receipts or 66.6% of total non-tax receipts of the Central Government; these receipts consist of government-owned  businesses  operational  profits  (B  101.2  billion),  and  B 14.8 billion  from  the Government Lottery Bureau. On the other hand, in the same fiscal year these SOEs accounted for B 149.8  million  (of  which  B  31.7  billion  of  subsidies)  or  6%  of  the  estimated  total  central government  expenditure;  the  Bank  for  Agriculture  and  Agriculture  Co-operatives,  the  State Railway  of  Thailand,  and  the  Mass  Rapid  Transit  Authority  of  Thailand  accounted  for  55.2%, 11.1%, and 6.6% of total expenditure respectively. As of January 2015, government guaranteed loans of SOEs (B 1 trillion) accounted for 17.8% (18.5% in June 2013) of the principal outstanding debt of Thailand (B 5.6 trillion).136"", '3.129.
