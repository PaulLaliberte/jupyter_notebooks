During the period under review, Barbados continued to implement a number of incentives programmes  targeted  solely  or  partly  at  the  promotion  of  exports.  Some  of  these  programmes have been notified to the WTO.

The  programme  aims  at  promoting  the  production  of  selected  products required for domestic use and in demand extra-regionally, as well as enhancing the use of local value added and fostering production for export. The incentives under the programme are granted under the Fiscal Incentives Act of 1974 (Cap. 71A), they are approved by Cabinet, and monitored by  the  Barbados  Investment  and  Development  Corporation  (BIDC).  Approved  enterprises  are granted an 11 to 15-year corporation tax, VAT and customs duties holiday. Relief from customs duties  is  granted  to  all  imports  of  plant,  equipment,  machinery,  spare  parts,  raw  materials  and components  thereof  required  by  the  approved  enterprise  in  the  manufacture  of  an  approved product, where such articles are not available in CARICOM.', '3.83.

The list of goods  eligible  for  this  incentive  was  modified  in  2011.  In  2015,  it  included:  (a) raw  materials, semi-finished  goods,  containers  and  packaging,  as  well  as  other  inputs  used  in  production; (b) machinery,  equipment,  moulds,  tools,  spare  parts  and  other  parts  needed  for  production; and (c) samples and instructions, patterns and models.71 The authorities have indicated that the time-limit  for  using  and  exporting  or  re-exporting  raw  materials  and  other  inputs  is  12  months.
