Currently, the CORFO foreign trade guarantee (COBEX) programme gives a guarantee for loans to finance: investment or working capital for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises engaged in foreign trade, both as exporters and importers, whereas previously it was only given to exporters. The guarantees may be in pesos, euros or dollars or in foreign exchange derivative operations (in order to offset changes in the dollar rate).
