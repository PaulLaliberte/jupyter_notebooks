The  State  thus  continues  to  play  a  key  role  in  the  domestic  production  of  goods and services  in  Cameroon,  as  well  as  in  companies  active  on  the  international  scene. It has holdings in some 30 of the country's 50 leading companies in terms of turnover.94 The State is  therefore  an  actor  not  only  in  regulating  the  economy,  but  also  in  a  large  percentage of the domestic production which it regulates."", '3.104.  For  example,  the  (semi-public)  Société  camerounaise  des  dépôts  pétroliers  (SCDP)  still has a  monopoly  of  storage  of  petroleum  products,  while  SONARA  has  a  monopoly  of  the  supply of petroleum  products.

In  general,  the  situation  of  government-owned  institutions,  public  and  semi-public  (PSP) companies has not changed since 1999.95 Between 1986 and 1995, Cameroon adopted legislation to  rationalize  the  management  of  the  PSP  sector  through  reforms  involving  their  reorganization, liquidation  or  privatization.96  Two  committees  set  up  in  1997  for  this  purpose,  the  Technical Commission  on  Privatization  and  Liquidation  of  PSP  Sector  Companies  and  the  Technical Commission on Rehabilitation and Follow-up (CTR), are still operating.', ""3.106.  According  to  the  CTR,  no  PSP  company  has  been  privatized  since  2007.  None  has  been liquidated  either.  The  State's  holding  in  CAMTAINER  apparently  dropped  from  70%  to  52.8%. Several  companies  are  managed  by  the  private  sector  under  a  concession,  including the SONEL electricity  company,  the  container  terminal  at  the  Autonomous  Port  of  Douala  (PAD), and  CAMTEL.  In  general,  the  privatization  and  reorganization  process  has  not  met  with the expected  success.  The  reasons  may  include  the  fact  that  the  companies  hold  little attraction for potential buyers.""]"
