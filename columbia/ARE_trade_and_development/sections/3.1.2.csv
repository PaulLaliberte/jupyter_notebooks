Exports of vegetables require a phytosanitary certificate. Exports of all live animals require an Export Health Certificate, while exports of all animal meat (fresh or frozen) require an export certificate provided by the Government Veterinary or an authorized veterinary. The exportation of several types of seafood (conchs, crustaceans, fish, and lobsters) requires a permit, a certificate, and  a  completed  customs  declaration.  The  permit  must  be  obtained  from  the  Department  of Marine  Resources,  and  the  sanitary  certificate  from  the  Veterinary  Unit  (Department  of Agriculture).', '3.82.  Exports  are  exempt  from  internal  taxes,  and  zero-rated  for  VAT  purposes.  Until  2010, export  taxes  were  applied  on  some  live  animals,  lobsters,  and  cotton,  in  accordance  with  the Export Duty Ordinance (Amendment) Act No. 4 of 1970. The adoption of the VAT eliminated export taxes.', '3.83.

External Trade Order No. 32 of 1958 rules export restrictions and licensing; restrictions are generally for safety and health purposes. Until recently, export licences were managed by the now closed  Supply  Office;  they  are  currently  under  the  Ministry  of  International  Trade,  Industry, Commerce  and  Consumer  Affairs.  Exports  of  wild  birds  are  forbidden,  in  accordance  with  the CITES, and exports of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, as well as goods bearing the coat of arms or flag of St. Kitts and Nevis are restricted.']"
