The  supplier's declaration  of  conformity  is  an  admissible  instrument  only  for  products  or  services  of  low  to medium risk to human health and safety.

According to the authorities, the DRC currently has 271 standards concerning the following: foodstuffs  (141),  sizes  and  units  of  measurement  (14),  steel  (44),  timber  (13),  cement  (11), conformity  assessment  and  quality  management  (1),  electrical  engineering  (15),  and  plastic packaging (6). Salt and salted fish are the only products with technical regulations drawn up in the DRC;  cement  is  subject  to  European  standards  and  the  remaining  standards  have  been harmonized with the COMESA standards adopted in 2008, 2009 and 2015. All these standards are mandatory in the DRC, in accordance with Ordinance No. 75-271 of 22 August 1975 creating the National Standardization Committee.', '3.84.  The  Congolese  Control  Office  (OCC)  is  responsible  inter  alia  for  carrying  out  controls  on imports  and  exports  and  domestic  markets,  including  those  relating  to  technical  regulations  and standards in the DRC. The OCC was established by Ordinance-Law No. 74-013 of 10 January 1974 and  is  a  national  government  agency  with  its  own  legal  status.  It  was  converted  from  a State-owned  enterprise  into  a  government  institution  of  a  scientific  and  technical  nature  and  its new  status,  missions,  activities  and in  Decree  No. 09/42  of 3 December 2009. According to this Decree, it is the task of the OCC, as a third party, to assess conformity, meaning inspection, certification, testing or analysis, metrology and technical controls with  reference  to  national,  regional  and/or  international  standards.  The  OCC  is  approved  and recognized throughout the DRC for the purpose of issuing certificates of conformity with standards and  technical  regulations.

Although  only  salt  and  salted  fish  are  subject  to  national  technical  regulations,  it  is mandatory  for  goods  imported  into  the  DRC  to  be  inspected  at  the  border  or  prior  to  shipment from the country of provenance. Control of conformity with standards and technical regulations is compulsory for both domestic and imported products. Control involves the following: inspection on the  production  site  or  at  the  border;  laboratory  tests  (chemical,  microbiological,  physical  and mechanical) on samples taken either at the end of the production chain when domestic production is being inspected or upon unloading or destuffing, in the case of imports.', '36 WTO documents G/ADP/N/139/Add.1/Rev.1 of 18 October 2006 and G/ADP/N/145/Add.1 of', '18 October 2006.', '37 WTO document G/TBT/2/Add.79 of 15 July 2004.', '\x0cWT/TPR/S/339 • Democratic Republic of the Congo', '- 53 -', '3.86.  Any  product  covered  by  a  certificate  of  conformity  with  the  standards  or  technical regulations in force may still be subject to further conformity inspection when it is imported into the  DRC,  unless  there  is  either  a  mutual  recognition  agreement  or  an  explicit  subcontracting  or cooperation  arrangement  between  the  body  which  conducted  the  conformity  assessment  abroad and  the  OCC.  Even  if  such  an  agreement  or  arrangement  exists,  the  OCC  may  conduct  further controls if it considers, inter alia, that there is a risk that the product may have deteriorated during transport. The OCC has a technical control and metrology department. The scientific and industrial metrology  laboratory  is  in  the  process  of  being  accredited  to  ISO  17025,  with  support  from  the German  Metrology  Institute  (PTB).  However,  verification  of  temperature,  pressure  and  electrical measurements are not yet possible.', '3.87.  The OCC is an active member of ISO, the IEC and ARSO (ORAN). It is the enquiry point for standards  and  has  a  centre  for  the  dissemination  of  standards  and  certification.  The  OCC  has signed  mutual  recognition  agreements  with  two  countries:  Kenya  (Kenya  Bureau  of  Standards (KeBS) for standardization and conformity assessment) and Zimbabwe (Standards Association of Zimbabwe  (SAZ)  for  certification).  The  agreement  with  Zimbabwe  is  in  the  process  of  being renewed.  Inspection  prior  to  shipment  from  the  country  of  provenance  is  the  responsibility  of  a subcontractor, the company BIVAC, whose contract expired on 15 November 2015 and has been extended to 14 November 2016.', '3.88.  The DRC does not have a national accreditation system but participates, through the OCC, in the Standards, Quality Assurance, Accreditation and Metrology (SQUAM) programme launched by the SADC in 2000. This programme has provided the subregion with a technical framework for quality  management  involving  accreditation,  certification,  standardization  and  metrology,  with  a view to extending it to the legal and regulatory level.', ""3.89.  At  importation,  the  OCC  makes  various  charges,  which  may  amount  to  2%  of  the c.i.f. value, for the various mandatory controls, which cover about 3,500 of the DRC's tariff lines. Details of the entire range of OCC invoicing and levies are provided in Table A3.3. These levies are imposed several times on the same goods by the same or several bodies, are generally ad valorem and can hardly be regarded as payment for services rendered."", '3.90.

Food imports are covered by the ""Cassis de Dijon"" principle, but special arrangements are in place prior to their first sale in Switzerland.

There have been no major changes to Swiss labelling requirements. Labelling requirements are  generally  set  out  in  sector-specific  technical  regulations.

Country of production labelling is mandatory  for  all  imported  and  domestic  foodstuffs  and  some  raw  materials  used  in  food.74 According to the authorities, this is because the indication of the country of manufacture cannot be inferred from the origin of the product and provides relevant information to help consumers decide which  product  they  wish  to  buy.  In  accordance  with  the  Agricultural  Ordinance  on  Declaration75, imports  of  meat  and  eggs  produced  in  a  manner  prohibited  in  Switzerland  must  be  labelled  as such.

The  ordinance  was  amended  on  1  July  2015  to  include beta-antagonists (including ractopamine).76 The labelling requirements apply from the point of sale to  the  final  consumer  in  retail  trade  and  in  establishments  where  meals  are  prepared  for  the public, such as restaurants.

Draft SSs are released for a 60-day public comment period. Upon approval by the SSC, they  are  published  in  the  Government  Gazette.  Standards  are  reviewed  every  five  years  on average to assess whether they should be confirmed, revised, amended, archived or withdrawn.

Under  the  CPS  Scheme,  all  goods  on  a  control  list  must  meet  the specified safety requirements through pre-market testing and certification, and be affixed with the SAFETY Mark before they can be advertised, traded or displayed for sale in Singapore.
