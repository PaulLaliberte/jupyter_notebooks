Goods  exports  are  subject  to  several  exit  duties  and  taxes  ranging  from  1  to  10%,  in particular those on coffee (1%); fresh water (1%); gold and diamonds produced on a small scale (1.5%);  industrially  produced  gold  and  diamonds  (3%);  electricity  (5%);  mineral  products  and their  concentrates  (10%);  and  mineral  oils  (5%).  The  tax  on  timber  exports  depends  on  the species and the degree of processing (Section 4.2)45: exported logs are taxed at 10%; and edged sawnwood  at  5%.46  The  tax  base  is  the  f.o.b.  value.  However,  Article  73  of  Law  No.  11/025  of 24 December 2011 places a ceiling of 0.25% on all of the taxes levied on all exports of agricultural products.', '3.111.   Exports of certain types of timber (forest species for promotion) are subject to a charge of 2% of the ex-works (EWK) value per cubic metre of timber in the rough exported, which goes to the Ministry of the Environment. There is also a mining export levy of 0.5% on iron and ferrous metals, 1% on industrial metals, other metals and solid hydrocarbons, 2% on non-ferrous metals, 2.5% on precious metals, and 4% on precious stones (gold, diamonds), for products covered by the Mining Code, in place of the 10% tax on minerals. The basis for calculating these charges is the  selling  price  less  the  costs  of  analysis,  insurance,  transport,  and  marketing;  the  deductible costs may not exceed 15% of the market value (Mining Code, Article 241).', '3.112.  Since the previous review in 2010, the principal innovations with regard to export duties and  taxes  have  been  the  introduction  of  VAT,  at  the  zero  rate  for  exports,  and  taxation  of  the goods  exported  in  accordance  with  their  real  value  on  world  markets.  In  principle,  the  declared value may not be lower than the reference values regularly published by the DGDA on the basis of market price data compiled from world prices.47']"
