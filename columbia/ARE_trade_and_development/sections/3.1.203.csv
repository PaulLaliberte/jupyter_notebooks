As part of its efforts to harmonize with EU legislation on intellectual property rights (IPRs), and in accordance with its commitments under the WTO TRIPS Agreement33, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has a relatively comprehensive and recently updated legal framework. This includes  the  Law  on  Industrial  Property  (covering  patents,  trademarks,  industrial  designs, appellations of origin, and geographical indications) and the Law on Copyright and Related Rights, which  are  in  accordance  with  relevant  EU  Directives  and  pertinent  international  conventions.34 Under  the  Law  on  Customs  Measures  for  Protection  of  IPRs,  the  Customs  Administration  has authority to investigate cases of counterfeit goods and has the right to seize pre-emptively suspect goods.

Institutional responsibility for issues related to IP rights is divided between the Ministry of Culture  and  the  State  Office  of  Industrial  Property  (SOIP).  The  unit  for  Copyright  and  Related Rights within the Ministry of Culture is responsible for the implementation of copyrights and other related rights, including supervision of the organizations/agencies for collective management. The SOIP deals with industrial property rights (patents, trademarks, service marks, industrial designs, appellations  of  origin  and  geographical  indications).  IP  enforcement  institutions  include  the Customs  Administration,  the  Ministry  of  Interior  (MOI),  and  the  State  Market  Inspectorate (responsible  for  monitoring  markets  and  preventing  the  sale  of  pirated  and  counterfeit  goods). Pursuant  to  the  2010  Law  on  Copyright  and  Related  Rights,  the  MOI  is  authorized  to  prevent violation of copyrights on the market.', '3.100.  In  2007,  the  Government  established  the  Coordination  Body  for  Intellectual  Property (CBIP) with the aim of reducing IP rights infringements, in particular counterfeiting and piracy. The CBIP has facilitated a coordinated approach to IP policy and enforcement, and has been especially active  in  adopting  a  programme  to  fight  piracy  and  counterfeiting.  The  CBIP  also  engages  in promotional activities to raise awareness of the benefits of IP protection.', 'Copyright and related rights', '3.101.  Accession  to  the  WTO  underscored  the  urgent  need  for  the  Government  to  prevent copyright  infringement,  and  since  then  the  government  has  focused  on  building  the  capacity  of state bodies competent for enforcement.', '3.102.  At  the  time  of  accession,  the  Law  on  Copyright  and  Related  Rights,  was  in  principle  in compliance  with  the  WIPO  and  UNESCO  conventions,  the  EU  Directives,  and  the  minimum requirements of the TRIPS Agreement. Full TRIPS compliance was subsequently achieved through amendments  to  the  law,  concerning,  inter  alia,  retroactive  protection  of  rights  of  performers  to recordings of their performances, and the provision of equal protection for foreign and domestic holders of copyright and related rights.', 'Industrial property protection', '3.103.  Although the Macedonian industrial property legislation was in compliance with the TRIPS Agreement  at  the  time  of  accession,  in  order  to  increase  compliance  with  the  minimum  TRIPS standards,  two  new  pieces  of  legislation  have  been  enacted:  the  Amendments  to  the  Law  on Protection  of  Topographies  of  Integrated  Circuits,  and  the  new  Law  on  Industrial  Property.  The latter governs the acquisition, exercise, and protection of patents, industrial designs, trademarks, appellations  of  origin,  and  geographical  indications.

Trademark owners are obliged to use their trademarks to maintain their validity.', 'Enforcement', '3.106.  During  the  review  period,  progress  in  IP  rights  protection  has  been  uneven  and intermittent and, according to the EU Commission, further effort is required to enforce IPRs in a transparent and consistent manner. In its 2012 progress report, the European Commission notes that while there have been advances in both the legislative framework and administrative capacity, implementation  remains  a  challenge  as  ""a  solid  track  record  on  investigation,  prosecution  and trials  of  IPR-related  cases  has  yet  to  be  established,  as  violations  of  IPR  continue.""38  The authorities  note  that  a  methodology  for  the  collection  and  processing  of  statistical  data  for purposes of enforcement was adopted in 2012. Given its location in the Balkans, the country is a transit  point  for  legitimate  and  illegal  goods  between  eastern  and  western  markets;  however limited data are available.39', '3.107.  Some international brands are not formally represented or registered in the country and so, despite a sound regulatory framework, various investors (e.g. in the IT industry, broadcasting, film and music production and publishing, pharmaceuticals, food and beverages, consumer goods, and  advertising)  have  complained  that  their  products  marketed  in  the  country  are  subject  to  IP rights infringement. The  authorities note, however, that the majority of international brands are registered  either  through  filing  a  national  application  with  SOIP  or  an  international  application through WIPO (Madrid System). The total number of foreign trademark applications in 2012 was 3,619.', '3.108.  IPR  enforcement,  including  trademarks  protection,  is  formally  ensured  by  a  variety  of institutions and agencies (Table 3.10).', '3.109.  The  need  for  relevant  and  consistent  data  on  court  proceedings  against  IPR  right infringements  has  led  to  the  adoption  of  a  methodology  for  collecting  and  processing  statistical data. Its purpose is to establish a single, harmonized data system as a solid basis for measuring IP infringements. Data from the recently launched new methodology will be processed by the Ministry of Justice and published twice yearly, starting in June 2013.', '3.110.  Given  the  limited  size  of  the  Macedonian  economy  and  the  preference  in  the  business community  to  use  out-of-court  procedures,  only  a  small  number  of  IPR-related  cases  reach  the courts each year. The EU Commission notes that in 2011, 126 court proceedings were initiated for violations  of  IPR,  from  which  ""about  15  prison  sentences  and  a  number  of  fines  on  criminal offences  were  issued  to  individuals  by  the  specialized  IPR  departments  of  the  courts.""40  Courts with jurisdiction in IPR-related cases are the basic courts of first instance, courts of appeal, and the Supreme Court. Judicial protection of IPRs is provided by protection granted in civil law and criminal  law  as  well  as  administrative  protection.  The  Law  on  Industrial  property  also  provides court protection before the Administrative Court. Macedonian law also enables right holders or any interested party to petition the Public Prosecutor to bring charges against violators of IPRs.', '3.111.  Despite  some  improvements,  the  former  Yugoslav  Republic  of  Macedonia  still  ranks  low internationally in its protection of IPRs.41 As the EU Commission points out, the level of awareness or concern, in both the local business community and the public, with regard to IPR infringement remains  low  despite  activities  to  raise  awareness  of  the  importance  of  IP  protection.
