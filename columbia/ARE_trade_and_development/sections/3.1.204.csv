Transactions  by  companies  approved  under  the  Industrial  Free  Zones  Regime  (ZFI) are exempt  from  all  direct  or  indirect  taxation  under  a  legal  regime  that  dates  back  to  1990 and has not changed since the previous TPR in 2007.91 Companies under this regime must produce goods  and  services  intended  essentially  for  export.  Nevertheless,  a  maximum  of  20%  of  their production  may  be  sold  on  the  domestic  market  subject  to  authorization  by  the  Minister responsible  for  industry.  Goods  exported  from  ZFIs  are  exempt  from  all  the  duties  and  taxes applicable;  those  sold  on  Cameroonian  customs  territory  are  considered  to  be  imported', '88 Finance Law for 2013, Article 2.

The  main  activities  are  timber  processing,  the  agrifood  industry, especially coffee and cocoa roasting. According to the 2008 by the National Industrial Free Zones Office (ONZFI), investors complain of the unstable legal environment in which the fiscal benefits are  constantly  called  into  question  by  the  tax  and  customs  authorities.  Even  though  Article  15 of the free zone statutes provides for ""total exemption from direct or indirect taxes and charges, as well  as  from  registration  fees  and  stamp  duty  of  any  kind  whatsoever"",  it  is  not  unknown to hear investors complain of the introduction of new taxes. According to the report, the customs environment  is  hardly  favourable  to  investors.  The  time  taken  for  customs  clearance  of  various types of equipment and materials exceeds two weeks. Likewise, applications for approval are dealt with  on  the  basis  of  the  ordinary  law  regime  and  not  on  that  in  the  texts  on  free  zones in force.92 In March 2013, 43 companies had been registered by ONZFI.93', '3.98.  According to the General Tax Code, there is full exemption from direct taxes and charges and  from  registration  fees  and  any  type  of  stamp  duty  for  the  first  ten  years  of  operation. As of the 11th  year  of  operation,  only  profits  tax  applies  at  an  overall  rate  of  15%  instead of 38.5%.  The  taxable  fiscal  profit  is  calculated,  however,  after  deducting  25%  of  the  wage  bill paid  to  Cameroonian  employees  and  25%  of  spending  on  investment  during  the  financial  year. Deficits  posted  during  the  exemption  period  are  deemed  to  be  charges  carried  forward to the subsequent financial years and can be deducted from the profits made during these years, without any time-limit for carrying them forward.', '3.99.  ""Free  point""  status  is  preferentially  given  to  companies  which,  among  other  criteria, use raw materials  of  Cameroonian  origin,  are  established  close  to  their  supply  source or, for companies  already  existing,  guarantee  to  export  all  of  their  production  at  the  latest one year after being granted this status.', ""3.100.  It  should  be  mentioned,  however,  that  the  ZFI  regime  has  not  served  as  a  tool for development  of  Cameroon's  exports  and  has  not  boosted  foreign-market  oriented  productive investment,  or  created  new  companies  and  jobs.  On  the  other  hand,  application  of  this  regime has led  to  tax  reductions  for  entire  sectors  of  the  economy.  In  the  new  draft  law  on  economic zones,  a project  that  has  been  under  consideration  since  2005,  it  is  foreseen  that  companies previously approved under the ZFI regime and in possession of a conformity certificate that is still valid will, at their own request, either be absorbed into the future economic zones regime as soon as it is set up or return to the ordinary law regime and all the duties and taxes evaded over this period become payable."", '3.101.  In  seeking  to  establish  a  new  regime  with  the  aim  of  boosting  exports,  it  is  necessary to avoid distortions among companies depending on whether or not they export, and instead focus on improving the production infrastructure - water, electricity, communications, transport - which is cruelly lacking for Cameroonian companies at present. This would help to promote the industrial processing  of technologies within the economy.', 'the  dissemination  of', 'raw  materials  and', 'innovative', 'local']"
