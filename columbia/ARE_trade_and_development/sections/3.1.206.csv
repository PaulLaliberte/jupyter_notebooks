In 2010, Fiji introduced a new competition law, the Commerce Commission Decree (CCD) to integrate the functions of several laws into a single comprehensive one.42 It addresses competition affairs,  consumer  protection,  and  price  controls.  The  Government  is  reviewing  the  CCD  and considering specifying the details of its implementation such as rules and guidelines.', '3.80.  Under  the  CCD,  the  Fiji  Commerce  Commission  (FCC)  was  created  in  2010  as  an independent  statutory body to administrate the implementation of the Decree. The objectives of the  FCC  outlined  by  the  CCD  are  to  promote:  the  interests  of  the  consumers;  the  effective  and efficient development of  industry, trade or commerce; and the effective competition in industry, trade  or  commerce.  It  also  aims  to  ensure  equitable  returns  for  businesses  with  fair  and reasonable prices charged to consumers.', ""3.81.  In  general,  the  CDD  prohibits  restrictive  business  practices  such  as:  contracts, arrangements, or understandings that restrict dealings, affect competition or fix prices; misuse of dominant  market  position  to  eliminate  or  substantially  damaging  a  competitor,  or  prevent  a competitor's  entry  into  a  market  or  competitive  conduct;  bid  rigging;  exclusive  dealing;  resale price maintenance; and price discrimination."", '3.82.  With regard to mergers, the CDD provides the requirements that mergers and acquisitions must  meet.  Firms  engaging  in  acquisition,  directly  or  indirectly,  of  any  shares  in  capital  or  any assets, need to acquire clearance from the FCC before finalizing the deal. The FCC will conduct an analysis  and  assessment  of  the  merger  proposal.

Similar to Fiji's legislation in other areas, the CCD has been modelled on the legislation of its neighbour countries with due adaptation to its own specific situation."", '\x0cWT/TPR/S/330 • Fiji', '- 46 -', 'strengthening  a  dominant  position  in  a  market  will  not  be  approved.  Since  2013,  the  FCC  has received  and  authorized  three  acquisitions.43    The  UNCTAD  peer  review  suggests  that  to  reduce the  workload  of  the  regulator,  merger  regulation  should  only  be  made  subject  to  a  mandatory notification process over a set turnover threshold.', '3.83.  Proposed access agreements must be notified to the FCC for assessment at least 30 days before they take effect. Valid agreements must be registered at the FCC. Failure to do so will lead to invalidity and unenforceability of the agreement. When negotiation is conducted between parties to  an  access  agreement,  the  FCC  may,  upon  the request  of  the  parties,  attend  the  negotiations and facilitate agreement between the two sides. Where a dispute exists with regard to an access regime, it may be referred to arbitration procedures under the Arbitration Act.', '3.84.  In July 2015, UNCTAD carried out a peer review of Fiji\'s competition regime and proposed the following amendments: (i) inclusion of a definition of the term ""market"" and ""consumer"" in the CDD;  (ii)  careful  consideration  of  whether  Fiji  should  enact  more  specific  cartel  provisions,  or whether the current provisions should be modernized; (iii) further consideration of the provision on the misuse of market power; (iv) repeal of price discrimination prohibitions, as they inhibit price flexibility; and (v) introduction of a leniency policy for cartel conduct.44', '3.85.  So far, there have been no court cases on competition provisions in Fiji. All matters have been resolved via the FCC decisions. The UNCTAD peer review believes that this suggests a lack of awareness about the competition provisions of the CDD and recommends that the FCC extend its awareness  workshops  and  seminars  to  the  subject  of  competition  policy,  to  raise  the  level  of understanding of consumers and business about this area.', '3.86.  The  FCC  is  actively  pursuing  arrangements  for  international  cooperation  mechanisms.  To this effect, Fiji and Austria have recently agreed to a have a Memorandum of Understanding. The FCC  is  a  member  of  the  International  Competition  Network  (ICN).  Since  2010,  it  has  also participated in a number of training programmes and conferences jointly organized by the OECD and the Korea Policy Centre (KPC), and by the Small States Network for Economic Development (SSNED).', '3.87.  The  CCD  also  gave  the  FCC  the  authority  to  regulate  prices  replacing  the  Prices  and Incomes Board. Prices of a wide range of goods and services products continue to be regulated, such  as  milk,  butter,  sugar,  fish,  rice,  pharmaceutical  products,  fuels,  electricity,  water,  and telecommunications (Table A3.3).  In reviewing and determining the prices of regulated products, the FCC first publishes orders authorizing the price control of various products, and then reviews and  determines  the  prices  of  the  products.  The  frequency  of  price  review  and  the  calculation methods vary from product to product depending on the features of the product and the market. The FCC provides the Ministry for Industry, Trade, and Tourism (MITT) with recommendations. The FCC  monitors  prices  via  daily  on-site  inspections.45  Traders  have  the  right  to  challenge  price decisions by the FCC in court.', ""3.88.  The  Government’s  rationale  for  price  controls  stems  from  its  view  that  anticompetitive practices  are  common  in  small  developing  countries  such  as  Fiji  where  the  lack  of  sufficient competition  enables  market  participants  to  earn  abnormally  high  profits.  In  their  view,  price controls  are  therefore  necessary  to  protect  the  interests  of  low-income  users.  Price  controls, however,  might  also  distort  market  signals,  discourage  investment,  and  encourage  low-quality production. Many of the products currently under price control are agricultural items that could be produced in Fiji. According to UNCTAD, Fiji's price control policy is generally appropriate, but FCC should reconsider whether price control continues to be the most effective approach in relation to particular markets."", '43 FCC (2014), Annual Report of the Fiji Commerce Commission 2013, Suva. 44 Currently, Fiji and UNCTAD are working on a technical assistance programme on competition policy', 'for Fiji for the next few years.
