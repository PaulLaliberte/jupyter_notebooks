This  is  the  case  with  petroleum  products,  water  and  electricity  (Section 4.2); telecommunications  and  postal  services  (Section  4.4.2);  and  transport  (Section  4.4.4).

However, since the CCP\'s creation, one of the major challenges is the effective disposal of cases, including as a result of a significant reduction in the CCP\'s staff in 2013. Of particular concern is a backlog of almost 200 cases pending in various courts. The Competition Appellate Tribunal, established in July 2011 to  ensure  that  anti-competitive  behaviour  would  not  prevail  for  any  longer  than  it  should,  is reportedly dysfunctional as a result of the non-appointment of judges and has only decided on one appeal by 2014.93', '3.88.  In 2013, the CCP issued orders in five cases regarding abuse of dominance by business and deceptive  marketing.  Six  new  investigations  were  launched  relating  to  deceptive  marketing  and other anti-competitive practices. Among some of the more significant cases, the CCP handed out fines  to  14  long-distance  and  international  telecoms  operators  for  price  fixing  and  market allocation to the tune of PRs 9 billion, and imposed a fine of PRs 8.64 billion on manufacturers of urea  for  abuse  of  dominance.  Over  the  same  period,  the  CCP  also  approved  54  mergers, acquisitions  and  joint  ventures.  According  to  the  CCP,  it  has  approved  over  400  mergers  and acquisitions  since  2007.  Over  the  same  period,  the  CCP  was  successful  in  unearthing  several cartels  including  in  banking,  accounting  services,  fertilizer,  cement  and  sugar.  In  all,  21  orders were passed to correct prohibited agreements, 15 to eliminate situations of abuse of dominance and 10 to promote fair marketing. As part of its research function, the CCP looks at various sectors from a competition standpoint and identifies vulnerabilities and government interventions that may be  distorting  incentives,  causing  information  failures  and  encouraging  anti-competitive  practices within the industry structure. According to the CCP, market studies serve as a diagnostic tool that allows  it  to  evaluate  how  competitive  markets  are  and  work  out  steps  to  improve  the  state  of competition  in  particular  sectors.  A  wide  range  of  competition  issues  are  covered  in  the  CCP reports,  including  market dominance, entry  barriers,  the  effect of international  developments  on the national market and the regulatory mechanism.

The Namibian Competition Act was promulgated in 2003, and has been in force since 2008. The  Namibian  Competition  Commission  (NaCC)  was  set  up  in  accordance  with  the  Act.  The Competition  Act  prohibits  restrictive  business  practices, including  agreements  between undertakings  to  fix  prices,  engage  in  collusive  tendering,  set  minimum  resale  prices  or  limit production.  It  covers  both  horizontal  and  vertical  agreements  among  businesses.  The  Act  also prohibits abuse of a dominant position by an entity or group of entities.', '3.89.  In  2012,  the  Namibian  Competition  Commission  published  monetary  merger  notification thresholds  and  threshold  criteria  for  the  application  of  the  abuse  of  dominance  provisions  under the  Competition  Act.  According  to  the  new  regulations,  the  merger  control  provisions  of  the Competition Act apply to an undertaking whose annual turnover in, into or from Namibia exceeds N$10 million, or whose assets in Namibia are greater than N$10 million.', '3.90.  In 2012, the NaCC adopted a draft leniency policy, under which cartel members may secure immunity  from  prosecution,  or  significantly  reduced  fines,  if  they  come  forward  and  confess collusion. The policy is currently under review by the MITSD.', '3.91.  In addition to the NaCC, which is responsible for regulating competition across all economic sectors,  Namibia  has  several  authorities  regulating  specific  sectors.  These  include  the  Bank  of Namibia  (BoN),  the  Communications  Regulatory  Authority  of  Namibia  (CRAN),  the  Namibia Financial  Institutions  Supervisory  Authority  (NAMFISA),  and  the  Namibian  Ports  Authority (Namport).  Both  the  BoN  and  CRAN  have  clear  overlaps  with  the  NaCC  in  terms  of  competition issues.  The  legislation  establishing  NAMFISA  and  Namport  specifies  no  competition  mandate  for either institution. Even so, situations could arise which would make it difficult for these four sector regulatory  agencies  and  the  NaCC  to  carry  out  their  respective  mandates  due  to  issues  of concurrent  jurisdiction.  So  far,  Memoranda  of  Understanding  exist  between  the  NaCC  and Namport,  the  Bank  of  Namibia  and  CRAN,  while  negotiations  to  conclude  either  an  MoU  or  MoA with NAMFISA are at an advanced stage.21', ""3.92.

While commending NaCC\'s enforcement of the merger control provisions of the Act, the study found that its enforcement of the restrictive business practices provisions had lagged behind, with no contravention found since the  NaCC\'s  establishment.23  The  authorities  indicate  that  efforts  are  under  way  to  ensure  that NaCC  has  sufficient  resources  to  ensure  it  meets  its  mandate  as  regards  restrictive  business practices.', '3.93.
