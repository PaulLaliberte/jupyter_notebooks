In addition,  technological  parks,  science  parks  and  industrial  parks  are  seen  as  tools  to  stimulate investment,  and  to  promote  research,  job  creation,  and  the  development  of  modern  production infrastructures. Article 92 of the Constitution stipulates that  each zone with an economic regime that differs from the general regime must be regulated by separate legislation. Special economic zones and priority development areas can be created by the Verkhovna Rada at the initiative of the President, the Cabinet of Ministers, or local authorities.', '3.114.  In general, the nine special economic zones are regulated by Law No. 2673-12 ""on General Principles of Creation and Functioning of the Special (Free) Economic Zones"" of 13 October 1992 (as amended).132 However, each zone is governed by its own legislation (Table 3.16). The priority development areas have been established for a period of 30 years.133 The assistance programmes available in a special economic zone or a priority development area are particular to that zone or area. In principle, tax advantages could take the form of exemption from corporate income tax, customs duties, and land tax, as well as deferral of VAT payments. However, as the state budget law  for  2005  cancelled  all  tax  privileges  for  special  economic  zones  and  priority  development areas, benefits currently accorded are confined to the conditions applicable under the general tax regime of Ukraine.134 Support has been negligible in the priority development areas since 2008. In the special economic zones, exemptions from the land tax amounted to Hrv 38.8 million in 2011 and 2012, but otherwise this incentive has not been used. However, the possibility for enterprises to defer their payments of value added tax on imports through the issue of promissory notes has been a measure of growing economic importance in the special economic zones.135 The estimated value of this assistance has risen from an estimated Hrv 36 million in 2008 to Hrv 294 million in', '129 Law No. 2010-d ""On Amendments to Some Laws of Ukraine to Ensure Competitive Conditions for the', 'Production of Electricity from Alternative Energy Sources"" of 4 June 2015.', '130 For hydroelectric energy, the premium is only applied to micro, mini, and small hydroelectric power', 'plants.', '131 Cabinet of Ministers\' Resolution No. 369 of 27 May 2013.  132 Other relevant provisions are Articles 401-405 of the Civil Code No. 436-IV of 16 January 2003 (as amended in 2015), and Cabinet of Ministers\' Resolution No. 1199 ""On Adoption of a Sample Contract for the Implementation of the Project on the TPD of a Special (Free) Economic Zone"" of 5 July 1999 (also as amended in 2015).
