In addition to the exporter himself, who must be approved through a complex procedure, exporting  from  Cameroon  usually  requires  the  intervention  and  approval  of  at  least  six  entities: a forwarding agent, the Customs, the SGS, a customs broker, MINCOMMERCE, an approved bank, and the CNCC. Each of these levies fees for the export transaction, so decreasing the exporter's earnings  accordingly.  The  aim  of  the  GUCE  is  to  streamline  these  operations  by  grouping  them within  the  same  entity,  as  far  as  possible,  subject  to  an  additional  fee  of  CFAF  15,000  (€23).84 In March  2013,  it  grouped  the  activities  of  customs  brokers,  the  Customs  and  MINCOMMERCE, but not those of forwarding agents or those connected with the Port and obtaining the ECTN."", '82 Law No. 2000/017 of 19 December 2000. 83 Annex 1 to the Finance Law No. 89/001 of 1 July 1989. 84 Online information from the GIE (GUCE).

As is the case for imports, exports are restricted to persons with exporter/importer status. Several  steps  are  required  to  obtain  this  status:  listing  in  the  RCCM,  which  applies to all businesses,  against  payment  of  CFAF  41,500  to  49,000  (€63-75).  The  business  also  has to forward85  a  hand-written  application  to  the  chief  clerk  of  the  local  court  of  first  instance; two certified  copies  of  the  articles  of incorporation;  two  copies  of  the  ""declaration  of  compliance and conformity"", or the ""notarized declaration of payment""; the certified list of directors, managers or  partners  permanently  and  personally  liable  or  with  the  power  to  commit  the  company; two extracts  of  the  criminal  record  of  the  aforementioned  persons  or,  if  this  is  not  available, any other document replacing it. Non-Cameroonians must also provide an extract of the criminal record  drawn  up  by  their  own  competent  authorities.  Lastly,  exporters  also  have  to  register in MINCOMMERCE\'s  register  of  exporters  and  importers  (see  the  section  on  imports  above), against  payment  of  CFAF  25,000  (€34),  and  this  registration  has  to  be  renewed  each  year. It is hardly necessary to point out that these formalities are such as to discourage entrepreneurs, particularly smaller ones, from engaging in export.', '3.88.  All exported goods, irrespective of their value, must be the subject of a detailed declaration. Goods  exported  for  commercial  reasons  may  only  be  declared  to  the  Customs  by  a  customs broker.  Some  companies,  however  (oil  companies  in  particular)  are  authorized  to  declare  their exports to the Customs themselves.', '3.89.  The  mandatory  inspection  of  exports,  which  has  been  the  responsibility  of  the  SGS since 1998, applies to logs and sawn wood; the exporter\'s customs broker must make an export declaration  domiciled  with  an  approved  bank  to  the  SGS,  pursuant  to  the  CEMAC  regulations (see common report). The export documents must be handed over to the SGS at least 72 hours prior to shipment and must also include a list of documents. The SGS is responsible for forwarding the  copies  of  the  export  declaration  to  the  exporter\'s  bank  and  the  authorities  concerned (including the  customs  administration).86  The  SGS  also  charges  0.95%  of  the  f.o.b.  value of all shipments amounting  to  over  CFAF  500,000  (€760)  for  its  ""inspection  and  control"" services (see section 3.1.2 above).', 'is  paid', '3.90.  The 11 documents to be provided listed in the Doing Business Indicator include: the order form  or  sales  contract;  the  domiciled  definitive  invoice,  the  receipt  proving  payment of the order if it in  cash,  the  SGS  export  declaration  domiciled  with  a  bank, the €1 movement  certificate  for  exports  to  the  EU,  signed  by  the  Chamber  of  Commerce, or the movement certificate for exports to CEMAC, signed by the CCIMA, or the CAPEF depending on  the  product;  the  packing  certificate  for  exports  in  containers;  and  the  application for ""extra-legal  work""  (TEL).  The  latter  is  for  payment  of  customs  officers  outside  their  normal working  hours,  after  3.30  p.m.,  amounting food and accommodation. Exporters also have to obtain the ECTN from the CNCC (see Table 3.3 above) and attach it to the export documents. If this is not done, the ECTN can still be obtained up to five days after the ship has left against payment of a penalty of 50% of the amount originally due.', 'to  around  CFAF  4,000/hour  plus']"
