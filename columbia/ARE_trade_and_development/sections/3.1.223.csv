Since the previous Review in 2010, there have not been any major changes to the legislative and institutional framework regulating customs procedures in Belize. Belize's Customs and Excise Department  oversees  the  importation  and  exportation  of  goods.  The  main  laws  remain  the Customs and Excise Duties Act, the Customs Regulation Act, and the Exchange Control Regulation Act.1  During  the  review  period,  the  Customs  Department  reviewed  the  draft  Customs Harmonization Bill and Customs Regulations for the CARICOM region. According to the authorities, the Bill will provide greater support to ASYCUDA World and post clearance audit, and  will contain provisions  for  binding  advanced  rulings.  The  Bill  was  approved  by  CARICOM  in  September  2016, and is to go to the Attorney General's Office for final vetting and then to the National Assembly for approval."", ""3.2.  ASYCUDA World has been implemented throughout Belize's customs territory since 2011. The authorities  stated  that  the  implementation  of  ASYCUDA  World  resulted  in  a  shift  to  a  more  risk-based approach and the adoption of post clearance audit. The World Bank's Doing Business report, however, ranked Belize 117th in 2016 among 189 economies in terms of the ease of trading across borders (Table 3.1), down from 107th in 2012 (among 183 economies in the world).2 Belize's rank indicates  a  performance  that  is  generally  lower  than  the  regional  average  for  Latin  America  and the  Caribbean.  The  authorities  insisted  that  ASYCUDA  World  reduced  the  customs  clearance  time for  traders,  as  all  customs  posts  designated  for  the  clearance  of  commercial  consignments  are automated and all declarations are electronic.

Since  the  previous  Review  in  2008,  there  have  been  significant  changes  to  customs procedures.  Jordan  started  implementing  single-window  procedures  from  2009,  with  15  single-window  centres  operating  in  2015.  The  Customs  Law  of  1998,  last  amended  in  2012,  regulates customs  procedures  in  Jordan.1  Jordan  Customs  implements  the  Customs  Law  and  conducts customs  clearance,  and  other  competent  authorities  are  involved  in  implementing  TBT  and  SPS related inspections and licensing procedures at the border, such as the Jordanian Standards and Metrology Organization (JSMO), the Jordanian Food and Drug Administration (JFDA), the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources.', '3.2.  Companies  (both  local  and  foreign)  registered  as  commercial  importers/exporters  with  the Ministry  of  Industry,  Trade  and  Supply  (MITS)  may  import  and  export  for  commercial purposes. Foreign commercial traders are subject to a foreign equity limit of 50%; the Council of Ministers may allow a foreign investor to own or contribute with higher percentages in projects of large scale or special importance. For a company to be registered as an importer/exporter, it must become a member of the Chamber of Commerce, or Chamber of Industry, and its premises must have been inspected and approved by the local municipality.', '3.3.  Once registered as a commercial importer, a company must obtain an importer card from the MITS (according to the authorities, this takes about 30 minutes). Under the Import and Export Law of 2001 (Article 3A), the importer card provides the commercial trader with a specific number and file  that  facilitates  customs  clearance.2  Companies  without  valid  importer  cards  may  still  import goods for commercial purposes, subject to a penalty equal to 2.5% of the value of the imported goods.  Individuals  are  not  eligible  for  a  card;  hence,  such  importers  are  always  subject  to  the 2.5% penalty.', '3.4.  Since  2010  Jordan  has  fully  implemented  ASYCUDA  WORLD,  allowing  online  customs declaration  submissions,  which  has  reduced  the  customs  clearance  time  for  traders  (Table  3.1). The e-declaration share is 100%. Jordan has also implemented a number of other reforms during the  review  period  to  facilitate  trade.  For  example,  Jordan  initiated  a  ""golden  list""  programme  in 2005 and upgraded it in 2010, which gives preferred operator status to companies demonstrating low risk and strong compliance history with customs requirements. Jordan Customs also reduced the  ratio  of  containers  subject  to  physical  inspection  to  35-38%,  from  100%  before  1999,  and 60% in 2000. According to the World Bank\'s Doing Business reports, in 2015 Jordan ranked 54th among 178 economies in terms of the ease of trading across borders, compared to 59th in 2008.3', ""3.5.

Customs  valuation  is  based  on  the  second  schedule  of  the  Customs  (Control  and Management)  Act  of  2013.  The  valuation  methodology  is  now  consistent  with  the  WTO  Customs Valuation Agreement. The transaction value is to be used first for valuation purposes, followed by the  transaction  value  of  identical  goods,  the  transaction  value  of  similar  goods,  the  deducted valuation, and computed valuation, in that order. However, the order of application of the last two valuation methods may be switched if both the Comptroller of Customs and the importer agree.', '3.5.  Antigua and Barbuda has not notified the change in valuation methodology to the WTO.', '3.6.  Antigua and Barbuda does not maintain any non-preferential rules of origin. For imports from other  CARICOM  members,  it  applies  CARICOM  preferential  rules  of  origin.  To  comply  with  these rules,  goods  are  deemed  to  be  from  the  Common  Market  if  they  have  been:  (a)  completely produced  within  CARICOM;  or  (b)  produced  within  CARICOM  wholly  or  partly  from  materials imported  from  third  countries,  provided  a  substantial  transformation  has  taken  place  within CARICOM.  Substantial  transformation  may  be  achieved  by  change  of  tariff  heading,  or  by complying with the requirements defined specifically for each tariff heading in Part A of the List in Schedule  II  of  the  CARICOM  Treaty.  Under  a  ""safeguard""  mechanism,  a  manufacturer  may  use materials  from  outside  the  region  when  they  are  not  available  in  a  CARICOM  State.  However,  a waiver must be obtained from the Council for Trade and Economic Development to authorize such imports.  Duty-free  treatment  is  accorded  only  if  goods  are  shipped  directly  between  member states.
