Imports  of  narcotics,  certain  weapons,  and  animals  or  plants  listed  in  the  appendices  of  the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) may be prohibited  or  subject  to  import  licensing  requirements  for  reasons  of  national  security, safeguarding  consumer  health  and  well-being,  and  preserving  domestic  plant and  animal  life  and the  environment.  Japan's  Foreign  Exchange  and  Foreign  Trade  Act  governs  import  licensing procedures.25 In addition, some commodities, including certain fish, are subject to import quotas, unchanged since Japan's previous review."", ""3.31.  At present, products that require import approval or are prohibited include: certain marine products,  certain  medicines  and  chemical  products,  propellant  powders,  nuclear  goods,  weapons, wild  animals  and  plants,  substances  that  deplete  the  ozone  layer,  specified  hazardous  wastes, certain chemical weapons production materials, alcohol, rough diamonds, cultural property illegally removed  from  Iraq,  all  goods  from  the  Democratic  People's  Republic  of  Korea,  and  weapons  and other items from the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and Eritrea, and Charcoal from Somalia, and chemical weapons  and  other  items  related  to  chemical  weapons  programme  and  cultural  property  illegally moved from Syrian Arab Republic, as per United Nations Security Council Resolution.26 Licences to import are issued free of cost. Japan amended the Customs Law in March 2015; the amendment added  the  products  designated  under  Article  2,  paragraph  15  of  the  Law  on  Securing  Quality, Efficacy and Safety of Products including Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices to the list of items subject  to  import  prohibition.  In  a  2016  amendment  of  the  Customs  Law,  Japan  added  goods produced  through  the  use  of  unlawfully  obtained  trade  secrets  (as  stipulated  by  the  Unfair Competition Prevention Act) to the list of items subject to import prohibition."", '3.32.  In 2014, Japan added to the list of items subject to import prohibition  some substances as ""narcotics"" (defined under the Narcotics and Psychotropic Control Law); as a result, the import of these  substances  without  a  licence  is  prohibited.  In  the  same  year,  Japan  also  added  some psychoactive  substances  to  the  list  of  items  subject  to  import  prohibition  as  ""designated substances"" (defined under the Law on Securing Quality, Efficacy and Safety of Products including Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices); the import of these substances without a specific reason is prohibited by law.', '3.33.  In  2014,  Japan  amended  the  Foreign  Exchange  and  Foreign  Trade  Act.  The  amendment added  ""chemical  weapons  and  other  items  from  Syria""  (on  24  January  2014)  and  ""cultural property  illegally  removed  from  Syria""  (on  18  September  2015) to the  list of  products  subject  to import  licensing  requirements  and  removed  ""weapons  and  other  items  related  to  nuclear programmes  or  ballistic  missile  programmes  from  Iran""  (on  22  January  2016)  from  the  list,  in response  to  the  UN  Security  Council  Resolution.

Japan  uses  quantitative  restrictions  on  imports  (import  quotas);  according  to  the authorities,  the  quotas  adhere  to  the  WTO  Agreements.  Products  subject  to  import  quotas (unchanged  since  2007)  include:  certain  fish  products  and  controlled  substances  listed  in  the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer.', '3.35.  The  Ministry  of  Economy,  Trade  and  Industry  (METI)  is  responsible  for  administering  the import quota system. Eligible importers are issued with an import quota allocation certificate. The method for allocating quotas, specified in METI notices, has not changed since 2007 and remains somewhat  complex.  Quota  allocations  are  decided  on  an  annual  basis.  Fish-related  quotas  are allocated based on domestic supply and demand, e.g. the amount of imports, domestic production, consumption,  and  prices  in  the  previous  year,  as  well  as  projections  for  the  coming  year.  These quotas  are  issued  by  the  METI  with  the  consent  of  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Forestry  and Fisheries  (MAFF).  Applicants  for  quota  allocations  must  meet  various  criteria.  Some  quotas  are allocated  on  a  first-come  first-served  basis.  When  the  amount  applied  for  exceeds  the  remaining unallocated quota, quotas are allocated by lottery.', '3.36.  Unused  import  quota  allocation  entitlements  are  non-transferable  and  cannot  be  carried over  to  the  next  period.  Additionally,  the  Government  does  not  reissue  certificates  for  unused quotas.', '3.37.  Japan  has  in  place  a  system  of  prior  confirmation  to  collect  data  on  certain  imports.  The system is intended to ensure that these imports are for specific uses, and to verify documentation and  origin  requirements.  Prior  confirmation  is  required  from  the  Minister  of  Economy,  Trade  and Industry,  or  the  relevant  minister.  The  system  is  used,  inter  alia,  for  goods  where  fraudulent declarations have been found in the past or for goods deemed to be at high risk for fraud. These include: vaccines of microbial origin for experimental use; specified foreign cultural property; tuna; swordfish;  whales;  poppy  and  hemp  seeds;  certain  substances  listed  in  the  Montreal  Protocol; radioisotopes; diamonds; and various other chemicals.']"
