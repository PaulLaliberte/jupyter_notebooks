Guyana's  legislative  and  institutional  framework  regarding  competition  and  consumer protection  policy  has  remained  largely  unchanged  since  2009.  The  Competition  and  Fair  Trading Act  (CFTA)  is  the  main  competition  law.  The  Competition  and  Consumer  Affairs  Commission (CCAC), which began its operation in 2011, is responsible for implementing the CFTA.47"", '3.104.  As  stated  in  its  preamble,  the  objectives  of  the  CFTA  are:  promoting  and  encouraging competition;  prohibiting  restriction  in  competition  and  abuse  of  dominant  market  positions;  and promoting consumer welfare. The CFTA has provisions against conclusion of monopoly agreements and abuse of market dominance. The CFTA does not have any provisions on merger controls.48 The authorities indicate that a Merger Control and Review Act is being drafted, and technical assistance is needed for further improvement in this area.', '3.105.  The CFTA prohibits all agreements between enterprises or associations of enterprises that have  or  are  likely  to  prevent/restrict  competition.  The  prohibited  agreements  include  horizontal agreements (those among competitors), vertical agreements (those among firms at different levels of  the  supply  chain),  and  concerted  practices.  For  example,  price  fixing,  production  quota, geographic  market  divisions,  or  tie  selling  are  prohibited.  However,  an  agreement  is  not considered  anti-competitive  if  the  CCAC  considers  that  it  contributes  to:  the  improvement  of production  or  distribution  of  goods,  or  the  promotion  of  technical  or  economic  progress,  while allowing consumers a fair share of the resulting benefit. There are no CFTA provisions on import cartels.', '3.106.  A dominant position in a market is defined by law as a position where a firm (or a firm with an interconnected enterprise) controls more than 40% of the market, and is powerful enough to operate  in  the  market  without  constraints  from  its  competitors. 49  While  the  existence  of  a dominant position is not in itself illegal, the CFTA prohibits its abuse.', '3.107.  All business, including sectors for which the Government bears a statutory responsibility to manage (e.g. public utilities), are subject to the CFTA.50 The authorities state that regarding the utilities sector, the Public Utilities Commission is the leading agency handling competition issues; the CCAC has a consultation role.51', '46 The Consolidated Fund collects all public money (including the revenues, trust and other money held', 'by public offices) for budgetary purpose. See Article 217, the Constitution of the Cooperative Republic of Guyana; Article 38, the Fiscal Management and Accountability Act 2003; and the Financial Administration and Audit Act.', '47 Before 2011, the Competition Commission was responsible for implementing the Competition and Fair', 'Trading Act (CFTA); the Competition Commission and the Consumer Affairs Commission merged together in 2011 and became the Competition and Consumer Affairs Commission.', '48 The Security Industry Act 1998 has certain regulations which deal specifically with mergers and', 'acquisitions (Take-Over Regulations).', '49 Articles 25 and 26(1), the CFTA.  50 The exemptions of application of the CFTA are listed in Article 4(1) of the CFTA. 51 Article 4(2), the CFTA.', '\x0cWT/TPR/S/320 • Guyana', '- 43 -', '3.108.  The CCAC may conduct investigations in response to a complaint received, or on its own initiative. There have been four investigations since the CCAC started its operations in 2011; two were  related  to  goods,  and  the  rest  were  related  to  services  including  air  transport  and distribution. The authorities consider that collecting information that helps them estimate market shares is the biggest challenge to the CCAC, and technical assistance is required in this regards so as  to  improve  the  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  competition  enforcement  in  Guyana.  The authorities do not publish information regarding market concentration such as Herfindahl Indexes.', '3.109.  The authorities consider that the Guyana Gold Board does not arbitrarily fix gold prices at which  it  sells  or  purchases  given  that  it  sets  its  prices  twice  a  day  in  accordance  with  the international prices given by the London Bullion Market AM/PM Fix (section 3.3.3).']"
