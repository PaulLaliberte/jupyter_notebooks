Gabon  has  not  made  any  notifications  to  the  WTO  regarding  its  standardization  regime (including  its  notification  authority  and  enquiry  point),  or  its  accreditation  and  certification procedures.  However,  it  appears  that  the  Ministry  of  Trade  and  Industry  is  the  notification authority, and the Standardization and Technology Transfer Agency (ANTT) is the enquiry point.', ""3.31.  In  principle  the  ANTT's  mission  is,  inter  alia,  to  provide  standardization,  accreditation and certification services in Gabon. It is also responsible for the promotion of quality in production activities and the establishment of an appropriate framework for metrology development.17"", '3.32.   The authorities have indicated that a draft law on the organization of the standardization process  is  under  preparation.  At  present,  standardization  may  be  initiated  by  the  Government, by consumer  associations  or  by  economic  operators  (producers).  The  ANTT  coordinates all activities  related  to  the  adoption  of  standards/technical  regulations.  On  receipt  of  a  request for the  introduction  of  a  standard,  it  forwards  the  files  to  the  relevant  technical  committee. In 2012  there  were  three  technical  committees,  dealing  with  agri-foods,  construction  and  civil engineering,  and  tourism  and  related  activities.  In  fields  where  there  is  no  technical  committee, the ANTT can set up an ad hoc technical committee to deal with a request for the development of a  standard.  The  technical  committees  are  responsible  not  only  for  developing  standards, but also  for  withdrawing  them  should  the  need  arise.  Draft  standards  undergo  a  public  enquiry stage, during which amendments are sought from the relevant stakeholders. They are, in principle, published on the ANTT website.18 Following this stage, the standards are adopted by the technical committees.  Finally,  they  are  published  in  the  Official  Journal  by  an  order  of  the  Minister responsible for industry.', '3.33.  As at 31 December 2012, Gabon had 11 (voluntary) standards in the fields of: agri-foods, construction and civil engineering, and tourism and related activities. According to the authorities, on  the  same  date  there  were  24  standards  at  the  public  enquiry  stage  and  almost  150  others at the final stage of the adoption process. All of them are based on international standards.', '3.34.  No  technical  regulations  originating  in  the  ANTT  are  in  force  in  Gabon.  In  the  absence of a centralized  framework  for  adopting  technical  regulations,  some  public  administrations  have done so with no legal basis per se. Thus, the Ministry of Water Resources and Forests has recently adopted mandatory standards on wood processing. To some extent, this situation is contributing to the weakness of the WTO notification system. The ANTT indicated, in the context of this Review, that  its  services  do  not  know  of  any  duly  adopted  technical  regulations  in  force  in  Gabon. However, the  various  ministries  that  have  adopted  technical  regulations  are  responsible for conformity  checks,  and  there  is  a  risk  that  this  will  lead  to  increased  numbers  of  officials operating at entry points.', '3.35.  On  21  February  2013,  Gabon  adopted  a  decree  establishing  a  national  system for the assessment of conformity to standards19, although it has yet to be implemented. A mutual recognition agreement on conformity assessment has been signed with Turkey.', ""3.36.  Gabon's ANTT has drawn up a programme of work for the period 2012-2014. It has been a member of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) since 1 January 2012."", '16 WTO document G/LIC/N/1/GAB/2 of 13 March 2002. 17 Decree No. 000103/PR/MCDIN of 25 January 2008. 18 Online information.
