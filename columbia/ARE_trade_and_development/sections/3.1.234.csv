The Dominica Bureau of Standards (DBOS) is the National Standards Body as mandated by Standards Act No. 4 of 1999. It is responsible for developing, applying, and monitoring standards and  technical  regulations.  It  has  been  notified  as  the  national  enquiry  point  for  the  TBT Agreement. The DBOS is under the responsibility of the Ministry of Employment, Trade, Industry and Diaspora Affairs and its general administration is guided by a 14-member National Standards Council (NSC) appointed by the Minister. On the recommendation of the DBOS, the Minister may declare a specification or draft standard to be a national standard. The authorities indicated that standards  incorporated  into  directives  and  laws,  generally  become  compulsory  standards,  all  of which are technical regulations.', '3.28.  The authorities indicated that standards are prepared under the guidelines of Articles 2 and 4 of the TBT Agreement. Specifications are made public and open for comment before becoming standards;  the  same  applies  for  revocations.  Every  declaration,  revocation,  or  variation  of  a standard must be published in the Gazette.', ""3.29.  The DBOS promotes the general adoption and implementation of technical regulations and standards,  establishes  or  designates  testing  facilities  or  laboratories,  and  provides  for  the examination and testing of goods. The Bureau is also in charge of certifying that goods, services, processes, and practices conform with national, regional or international technical regulations and standards,  and  of  declaring  standards  and  keeping  them  under  review.  The  DBOS  may  also provide advice to manufacturers on quality control. The authorities have indicated that conformity assessment is done through the DBOS' Monitoring System at the port of entry for imports and also through market surveillance."", '3.30.

The  DBOS  may  request  the  testing  of  goods  subject  to  a  technical  regulation.  If  tested goods fail to conform to the regulation, domestic use or export is prohibited unless the goods are marked as imperfect. Moreover, upon application by the Minister in charge of trade, a High Court may order the producer to cease the production of such good. The authorities indicated that, as at March 2014, the DBOS did not yet conduct any testing as it was in the process of establishing a testing facility.', '3.33.  The National Metrology Act 2009 reinstated the International System of Units as the legal units  of  measurement,  and  mandates  its  use  in  any  contract,  bargain  or  sale,  and  packaging.22 Additional  units  may  be  used  if  they  have  practical  importance,  are  widely  used  or  more appropriate in some specialized fields. All weighing and measuring instruments for trade must be the authorized units of measurement. The National Metrology Service is in charge of enforcing the legislation. The authorities indicated that, as at March 2014, the Act was not yet implemented.']"
