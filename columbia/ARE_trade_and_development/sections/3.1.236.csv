Since  11 April 2011,  there  has  been  a  requirement  for  merchandise  imports  and  exports, whatever their origin/intended use or the customs procedure applicable, to be accompanied by an electronic import or export information form (FERI/FERE, respectively); however, the latter is not yet in use. These documents are issued by the Multimodal Freight Management Office (OGEFREM), under  the  authority  of  the  Ministry  responsible  for  transport.12  The  FERI  is  required  for  the customs  declaration.  It  is  intended  to  provide  the  customs  services  with  information  concerning the  approximate  value  of  the  cargo,  its  tonnage  and  the  nature  of  the  merchandise.  Once  the charges have been paid, the FERI is made out in the port of shipment and validated by OGEFREM or its authorized agent. The documents required for issuing the form are: the bill of lading; the commercial  invoice;  and  a  form  specifying  the  weight,  nature  (tariff  line)  and  quantity  of  the goods. Since all these documents are already required for clearance, the result is duplication.', ""3.13.  The charges made by OGEFREM for each form amount to €60 for a 20-foot container and €110  for  a  40-foot  container;  normally,  the  cost  is  €0.50  per  unit  of  payment  (weight,  volume, linear metre). In the case of cargos bound for the DRC unloaded at transit ports, since the FERI covers the goods from the port of shipment to the port of unloading, a destination certificate (AD) must be issued in the transit ports to accompany the goods to the borders of the DRC. This costs US$20.  Moreover,  for  the  enrolment  in  the  shippers'  register  of  economic  operators  exercising activities  in  the  DRC,  personally  or  through  forwarding  or  shipping  agents,  OGEFREM  charges  a US$50 annual subscription fee."", '3.14.

The approval of a customs broker for clearing all goods (other than petroleum products) is subject to the payment of a US$100,000 deposit (US$250,000 for those authorized for petroleum products). The approval granted to customs brokers is valid throughout the national territory for a renewable period of three years. For goods transported inside the country under customs control, the broker may be required to provide security covering the whole of the duties and taxes payable. For  his  services,  the  broker  receives  a  commission  freely  negotiated  between  himself  and  the importer. In 2015, there were 130 approved customs brokerage agencies established in the DRC.', '3.15.

The  risk  factors  are  regularly  assessed  and  analysed  using  economic  and  econometric methods.', '3.20.  In addition to the traditional system, the DRC has a special risk management system called Système Orange, a centralized value-checking mechanism installed with the aid of UNCTAD in the form  of  a  value  database.

Since the previous review of its trade policy (TPR) in 2009, Morocco has continued to take measures to facilitate trade and shorten the time during which goods remain in customs zones and in  ports.  New  measures  streamlining  customs  procedures  have  been  introduced  with  a  view  to speeding  up  and  computerizing  customs  clearance,  notably  by  putting  in  place  the  BADR (computerized  online  customs  database),  which  has  been  in  operation  since  January 2009. Morocco has notified its Category A measures under the Agreement on Trade Facilitation.', '3.2.  The purpose of the BADR is to make the customs clearance procedure for both imports and exports totally paperless from the time goods come under customs control until they are released or  definitively  shipped.1  Through  the  BADR,  operators  have  online  access  to  all  useful  data informing  them  how  their  customs  procedures  are  progressing,  and  also  have  online  support available if needed.2 These services enable operators to carry out some 30 operations remotely, for example, requests to amend online declarations, remote printing of payment slips and viewing how  the  declaration  is  progressing.  The  measures  taken  to  computerize  the  customs  clearance route include digital signature of customs declarations and the adoption of a standard procedure with  the  banks  for  endorsing  bank  guarantees  using  the  BADR  computer  system.  Since  2012,  it has also been possible to obtain release and customs clearance remotely.', '3.3.  A  detailed  declaration  called  the  Single  Declaration  of  Goods  (DUM)  is  required  for commercial imports, placing them under a customs regime. The DUM has to be forwarded to the Customs  and  Excise  Administration  (ADII)  electronically  using  the  BADR.  Advance  customs clearance  is  encouraged  as  a  result  of  the  introduction  of  an  obligation  on  the  carrier  to  file  a summary  declaration  before  the  goods  arrive.3  Pursuant  to  the  new  provisions,  the  summary declaration has to be filed electronically within the time-limits specified according to whether the goods are imported by sea or by air.4 For users, the cost of using the BADR computer system is: DH 500 for each summary declaration, DH 100 for each DUM for imports, DH 50 for each DUM for exports, and DH 6 for each page of status reports or management statements.', ""3.4.  To lessen the time during which goods remain in customs zones, manifests are accepted in the  original  language  (Arabic,  English,  French,  Spanish)  and  since  2010  have  been  recorded electronically without any need for a hard copy. In 2015, electronic payment was incorporated into the  customs  clearance  process  by  introducing  a  service  allowing  customs  debits  to  be  paid  by credit card through the BADR. A national clearance credit is available and covers all transactions irrespective  of  the  bureau  of  import.  Other  measures  already  in  place  at  the  time  of  Morocco's previous  TPR  have  been  generalized,  for  example,  allowing  the  goods  to  be  released  simply  by submitting  the  release  order  edited  at  the  operator's  domicile;  and  the  opportunity  given  to operators  to  choose  a  customs  bureau  as  the  bureau  of  domiciliation  for  completing  customs formalities."", ""3.5.

Natural or legal persons wishing to engage in international trade activities must be registered in the Commercial Register."", '3.6.  Moreover, as part of the facilitation of foreign trade procedures, Morocco has established a virtual  foreign  trade  single  window  known  as  ""PortNet"",  which  is  managed  by  the  company PortNet SA  created  by  Decree  No. 2-10-146  of  26 April 2010.

The  copy  must  be  accompanied  by  invoices,  ownership  or  transport documents  and,  where  applicable,  packing  lists,  certificates  of  origin  and  any  other  documents required for application of the various customs and non-customs regulations at the border.6', '3.9.  Imported goods may be withdrawn after payment of or posting of security for the duty and taxes and, where applicable, after completing other formalities carried out by the ADII on behalf of other authorities.7 It is also possible to use clearance credits or to pay by a secured bond, the two procedures enabling payment to be deferred for up to 180 days. A new form of security has been introduced to cover transit operations between free zones and between these and entry and exit bureaux.', '3.10.  To  facilitate  customs  clearance,  economic  operators  may  set  up  customs  clearance warehouses and bays (MEADs) within or outside customs zones in ports or airports. Introduced in 2000,  the  MEADs  are  open  to  all  and  allow  goods  in  bond  to  be  provisionally  stored  in  these approved premises upon import or export, pending the assignment of a definitive customs regime. Pursuant to the 2014 Finance Law, MEADs may now only be set up by legal persons whose main activity is logistics or international transport in order to place the activity on a more professional basis. It makes the operation of MEADs subject to compliance with specifications laid down by the administration, defining the obligations and conditions to be met in order to engage in this activity. In May 2015, 67 MEADs were in operation.', '3.11.  In 2012, measures were taken to allow the temporary admission of containers8 without the operator filing any declaration or guarantee, subject to observance of the labelling requirements for their identification.9 If there are doubts, however, concerning compliance with the obligation to re-export the container, the customs services take other precautions such as requiring submission of a bond-note together with the declaration assigning a customs regime to the goods transported or a simplified declaration. As of May 2015, 26 operators had been authorized to benefit from this procedure.', '3.12.  In  partnership  with  the  private  sector  and  following  implementation  of  the  WCO\'s  SAFE standards, the customs introduced a programme for the approval of economic operators allowing candidate companies which pass an extremely strict audit to benefit from the administration\'s trust and from certain customs facilities. An approved economic operator (AEO) may be given the status of AEO-Customs Simplifications Category ""A"" or ""B"". In addition, AEO-Security and Safety status is also  granted  to  Category  ""A""  AEO-Customs  Simplifications  AEOs  which  comply  with  appropriate standards concerning security and safety.

There is a forum for ongoing dialogue in the form of framework agreements signed between the  customs  and  professional  associations  representing  various  sectors  of  activity.  These framework agreements provide for regular meetings with professional circles in order to identify ways of improving customs procedures. The areas for improvement identified are set out in a road map and progress is regularly evaluated. As of May 2015, seven framework agreements had been signed.

Nigeria became a signatory to the Revised Kyoto Convention on 28 June 2012.', '3.2.  Import  procedures  are the  same  for  both  foreigners  and  Nigerians.  Any  person  intending to import goods into Nigeria must complete an electronic import declaration (e-form M) through any authorized  dealer  bank,  irrespective  of  the  value.  In  addition  to  form  M,  the  importer  must provide:  a  detailed  description  of  the  goods,  including  commercial  name,  make,  whether  new, used  or  refurbished,  and  the  standards  adopted;  quantity;  unit  cost  of  goods;  total  cost  of  the goods;  cost  of  freight;  mode  of  transportation;  shipment  details  (i.e.  full  container  load,  bulk, loose  or  low  container  load);  any  other  charges  stated  on  form  M;  country  of  origin;  country  of supply;  pro-forma  invoice;  insurance  certificate;  regulatory  certificate/permits  (e.g.  NAFDAC, SONCAP  Pharmaceutical  Board  of  Nigeria,  etc.)  and  any  additional  documents  that  might  be prescribed  by  a  relevant  government  agency.

After  verification  of  the  information  provided  on  the  form,  the  authorized  dealer  bank  is required to submit the completed and approved form to the office of the scanning service and risk management  system  within  five  days  for  approval. E-Form  M  is  uploaded  directly  to the  customs platform  at  no  cost.  Since  2013,  NCS  has  been  in  charge  of  conducting  scanning  and  risk management  services  in  lieu  of  private  sector  operators.3  However,  the  Comprehensive  Import Supervision Scheme (CISS) fee of 1% on the f.o.b. value of imports has been maintained. Form M only  becomes  valid  for  importation  once  it  has  been  accepted  by  the  scanning  service  and  risk management system.  If accepted (the decision to accept or reject the declaration has to be made within a day), the documents are forwarded for clearance of goods.', '3.4.

Since 2011, the previous UNI-PASS system continued to be upgraded with its 4th generation system in operation as from April 2016. The 4th generation system was developed, aiming at user-centric services (i.e. users having more control, more choices or more flexibility), the Smart clearance system, and creation of integrated IT infrastructure for information resources.

These  are  based  on  international  regulations,  notably  those  of  the  revised Kyoto Convention  and  the  EU  Customs  Code  (for  customs  procedures),  and  include  a  section (Title 16) on the establishment of the Customs Conciliation and Expertise Commission (CCED) as the mandatory channel and procedure before turning to the courts.9 As of March 2016, the CCED was not yet operating.', '3.7.

Since 2006, the Customs has calculated the average time taken for clearance and how long goods remain under customs control, using a World Bank methodology. The average dwell time for goods at the Customs fell from 9.6 days in 2006 to 3.8 days in 2015. The average customs clearance time in 2015 was 0.75 days for all the various procedures and 2.3 days for the clearance  for  home  use  procedure.

By March 2016, 22,339 operators had been connected to the TTN platform. The information needed to complete the customs declaration is set out on the Customs website.  In  2015,  all  customs  declarations  were  handled  electronically  and  all  imports  declared electronically. There are no more manual declarations.', '3.9.  All  goods  imported  or  exported  must  be  the  subject  of  a  detailed  declaration  assigning  a customs procedure to them. The detailed declaration must be submitted upon arrival of the goods at the customs bureau or at the latest 15  days afterwards. Article 80 of the new Customs Code reaffirms the provision introduced by the 2004 Finance Law allowing the goods manifest (the main document required by the Customs) to be filed in advance before the goods arrive at the port or airport.  This  possibility  has  been  put  into  practice  since  April 2005.  The  manifest  is  forwarded electronically,  together  with  requests  for  ""fiscal  privilege""  (Section  3.1.2.6).

Goods deemed to be of low risk are earmarked for the ""green channel"" and are released at once; the release order (BAE) is issued automatically with a summary check  of  the  documents  submitted  or  transmitted  via  the  TTN.  According  to  the  information provided by the Customs, in 2015, 71% of customs declarations were directed towards the green channel, compared to 30% in 2004.', '3.13.

Those  sent  to  the  ""red  channel""  are  regarded  as  high-risk  and undergo physical inspection. The objective of the Customs is to keep the physical inspection ratio below 10% of the number of declarations filed. At end-2015, declarations directed towards the red channel  accounted  for  8.75%  of  the  total.  Inspection  may  only  involve  x-raying  the  entire container,  but  may  also  frequently  involve  x-raying  and  opening  each  package.  The  goods inspected  are  stored  in  the  operators\'  warehouses  before  receiving  a  provisional  release authorization  (APE)  or  an  authorization  of  release  for  consumption,  which  may  often  take  up  to 11 days. Issuance of an APE means that further technical controls or physical inspections must be carried out before the goods can be placed on the market.', '3.14.  While awaiting implementation of the CCED, three commissions are responsible for settling disputes relating to value, tariff classification or the origin of goods. According to the authorities, these commissions handle some 250 cases each year, mainly in relation to classification.

In  the  settlement  of  customs  disputes  the  dispute  is  defined  in  accordance  with  the  type of offences  noted  or  found:  offences  identified  by  customs  squads  (land),  offences  identified by Customs  Economic  Investigations  Bureaux  (ECOR)  or  offences  identified  during  inspections. When  a  violation is identified  the  identifying  officers  draw  up  a  report.  The  operator  in  question is summoned  by  the  head  of  the  unit  vested  with  the  authority  to  settle  disputes  by the Director-General  of  Customs.  He  classifies  the  violation  and  determines  the  penalty in accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  CEMAC  Customs  Code.  Customs  disputes  are  resolved by a  settlement  stating  the  amount  of  the  fine  and  the  destination  of  the  goods  in  addition to payment of duties.']"
