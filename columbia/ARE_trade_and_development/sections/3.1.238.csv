The VAT system partially follows the EU system.4 Supplies of goods or services whose place of supply is in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the import of goods into the country are generally subject to VAT. The general VAT rate is 18%; a preferential rate of 5% applies to a number  of  goods  and  services  including  food  for  human  consumption,  pharmaceuticals,  and publications.  On  imports,  VAT  is  payable  by  the  importer  to  the  customs  authorities.  It  is calculated  by  the  customs  authorities  conducting  the  customs  clearance  procedure.
