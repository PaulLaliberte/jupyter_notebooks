Customs  clearance  in  Cabo  Verde  is  subject  to  a  custom  user  fee  (taxa  de  utilização  das alfândegas).21 During the negotiations on Cabo Verde's accession to the WTO, some WTO Members were of the view that the fee, levied at a flat rate of 1.04% of the CIF value of imported goods, was not in conformity with Article VIII of the GATT 1994. Although Cabo Verde referred to studies of customs expenditures that suggested that the fee was roughly commensurate to the cost of the services rendered, Cabo Verde agreed to launch a new study to redesign the customs processing fee, possibly introducing a minimum and maximum charge per transaction. Cabo Verde undertook to revise its legislation regarding the customs user fee before the end of 2012. The issue is still under consideration."", '3.27.
