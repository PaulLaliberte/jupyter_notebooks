The  authorities  indicated  that  Sierra  Leone  does  not  operate  any  export  subsidy programmes.', '3.63.  Established  in  2007,  the  Sierra  Leone  Investment  and  Export  Promotion  Agency  (SLIEPA) has  the  mandate  to,  inter  alia,  encourage  and  promote  the  development  of  exports-oriented activities,  with  a  special  focus  on  agriculture  and  marine  resources.  It  provides  exporters  with information  on  market  access  and  technical  assistance  opportunities,  and  advocates  their interests. SLIEPA is governed by a board composed of representatives from relevant ministries as well  as  the  Chamber  of  Commerce,  Industry  and  Agriculture,  the  bankers  association,  and  the', '17 The Agricultural Act (Public Notice No. 66 of 1974) – (Cap 185), 12 December 1974; and the Rural', 'Area Act (Public Notice No. 16 of 1990) – (Cap 75), 31 December 1990.', '\x0cWT/TPR/S/303 • Sierra Leone', '- 36 -', ""association  of  manufacturers.  The  agency  is  funded  under  the  Government's  regular  budget. Activities  undertaken  since  2007  include  facilitation  of  trade  fairs  and  exhibitions;  provision  of market  intelligence  and  trade  information;  provision  of  capacity  building  in  export  value  chains; and development of product profiles for some non-traditional exports."", '3.64.  In  2010,  SLIEPA  developed  a  National  Export  Strategy  (NES)  with  a  vision  to  transform Sierra  Leone  into  a  flourishing  country  through  a  globally  competitive  export-driven  economy.18 The  NES  identified  agriculture,  fisheries,  mining,  and  tourism  as  being  strategic  for  export performance,  and  defined  government  interventions  accordingly.  The  NES  also  aims  to  address cross-cutting  issues  such  as  access  to  trade  finance,  transport  and  trade  logistics,  and  trade information  services.  Over  its  implementation  period  (2010-15),  the  strategy  is  expected  to  put nearly US$590 million into the economy, mainly in the agriculture sector. An assessment by the SLIEPA  found  the  degree  of  implementation  of  the  NES  and  its  impact  to  be  relatively  high  in agriculture,  mining  and  tourism.  Cross-cutting  strategies  related  to  trade  finance,  quality management, and trade facilitation have had varying degrees of implementation, in general, falling short of stated objectives.', '3.65.  An assessment of the strategy19 found that export capabilities were improving, although the awareness of local producers about export opportunities remained limited. The report also found that  the  physical  infrastructure  is  largely  inadequate,  and  compliance  with  quality  requirements and  standards  is  still  a  major  challenge.  Limited  access  to  credit  restricts  considerably  the development of export-oriented activities, especially in the absence of any export credit guarantee or credit risk insurance scheme. The report also pointed out the land-tenure system, in its current form,  especially  the  application  of  the  customary  land  system  in  rural  areas,  as  an  important barrier to the development of the agriculture sector (section 4.1).', '3.66.  In  2013,  the  authorities  dissolved  the  Sierra  Leone  Produce  Marketing  Board20,  a  state-owned enterprise solely responsible for the purchase, export, and marketing of agricultural cash crop  products  including  cocoa,  coffee,  cashew,  palm  oil,  rice,  and  sorghum.  The  Board  was replaced by a limited liability company, the Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Company Limited.']"
