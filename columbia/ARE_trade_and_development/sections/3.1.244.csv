Cameroon has been using market values to calculate forestry taxes and export duty on logs (HS  44.03.49)  since  1997.  The  f.o.b.  value  of  logs  for  export  is  determined  by  an  ad  hoc commission set up for this purpose, chaired by the Director-General of Customs, and is published in an order from the Minister in charge of finance. The f.o.b. value of each species is usually that calculated  on  the  basis  of  international  market  prices.  According  to  the  authorities,  however, in the past  some  species  have  benefited  from  a  discount  in  order  to  offset  the  shock of the international financial crisis. The values are revised every six months.90']"
