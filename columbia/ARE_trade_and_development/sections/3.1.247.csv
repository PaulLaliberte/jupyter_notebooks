As  Ukraine  has  regularly  experienced  bouts  of  inflation,  the  maintenance  of  price  stability  has frequently  been  regarded  as  a  major  task  of  the  government  and  the  regional  administrations. Tables  A3.4  and  A3.5  enumerate  goods  and  services  subject  to  price  control  measures  in  the energy sector.', '3.146.  Specifically,  in  respect  of  price  control  measures  on  pharmaceuticals,  the  Cabinet  of Ministers has established a National List of Essential Drugs satisfying the basic health needs of the population and included inter alia due to their ""cost effectiveness"".172 The Ministry of Health has elaborated a second list of socially oriented pharmaceuticals and medical products.173 The prices for  these  goods  are  indicated  in  separate  legislation.174  The  purchasing  procedures  for  drugs  by publically  funded  healthcare  institutions  are  regulated  under  legislation  dating  from  1996.175  For drugs included in these lists, mark-ups are capped at 10% at the wholesale level and 10%-25% for pharmacies.', '3.147.  In 2008, the Cabinet of Ministers introduced minimum prices for vodka and other spirits.176 The stated purpose was to fight illegal production and trade in these goods. The minimum prices, set  for  sales  at  the  wholesale  and  retail  level,  originally  applied  only  to  domestically  produced beverages.  However,  the  system  has  been  extended  to  imported  alcoholic  beverages  since June 2014.  The  minimum  prices  were  adjusted  upward  with  effect  from  1  September  2015,  but retain a substantial differential between whiskeys, rum, gin and geneva (UAH 545, retail), cognacs (UAH 420 to 470), and vodkas, liqueurs, cordials, and other spirits (UAH 274.5).177 The regulations thus allow vodka, of which there is substantial domestic production, to be sold at lower prices than many other (primarily or exclusively imported) spirits.178']"

Respecting the market mechanism and the right of businesses to set their own prices, the State may exercise price regulation to stabilize prices or to protect the legitimate interests of business entities, consumers, or the State. The Law on Price identifies four forms of price regulation, i.e. price ""valorization"", prices for goods and services determined by the State, price consultation, and the examination of ""price constituents"".', '3.151.  Price valorization, i.e. efforts to stabilize the prices of certain essential goods and services (covered  by  Articles  15  to  18)  affects  petrol  and  other  petroleum  products,  electricity,  liquefied petroleum gases, nitrogenous fertilizer and NPK fertilizer, plant protection chemicals (specified by law), vaccines preventing diseases for bovine animals and poultry, kitchen salt, milk for children under  six,  edible  sugar,  husked  and  un-husked  ordinary  rice,  and  preventive  and  curative medicines  for  human  use  (according  to  a  list  of  essential  medicines  for  use  in  medical establishments).131', '3.152.  Price determination by the State is in the form of specific rates, price ranges, or minimum or  maximum  charges  (Articles  19  to  22).  Specific  price  setting  applies  to  aviation  services132, including take-off and landing charges, flight management, assistance for ""flight assurance"", and security  screening; telecommunications  connecting  services;  and  electricity,  electricity transmission, and electricity system support services.133 Price ranges with specifically determined prices affect land and forests, ground water and potable water, rents and rent/purchase options for  housing  built  with  state  funds,  medical  treatment,  and  education/training  services.  Minimum (or maximum) prices are set for the rental of state-owned infrastructure, domestically produced cigarettes, public utility services, and certain ""national reserve"" goods. Price consultation, i.e. the mediation  of  a  governmental  authority  in  price  discussions  between  buyers  and  sellers,  can  be effected  for  important  goods  and  services  where  competition  is  limited  on  the  side  of  the  seller and/or buyer. Price constituents, i.e. detailed production costs, are examined when specific price setting is applied for goods and services subject to price ""valorization"", and for other goods and services  at  the  request  of  the  Prime Minister, ministers,  or  other  high-level  officials when  prices are changing ""abnormally"".', '3.153.  Since  2008,  certain  businesses  have  been  obliged  to  declare  their  selling  prices,  and changes to them, to the competent state authorities, e.g. the Ministry of Finance or provincial level Finance Departments.134 Price declaration affects industrial explosive materials, seaport services, airport  services,  domestic  airfreight  rates,  charges  for  transportation  by  car,  and  medicines  for human  use.135  The  Ministry  of  Finance  may  apply  controls  when  prices  increase  or  decrease ""groundlessly""  or  ""unreasonably"".  It  has  been  observed  that,  for  goods  and  services  subject  to price declaration, this measure is likely to lead to greater harmonization in the price calculations of market participants and thus more uniform profit margins, thereby ignoring the differences in risks facing many businesses.136', '3.154.  According to the authorities, the scope of price declaration and price registration measures has been reduced with the promulgation of the new Law on Price.137 Price registration is currently only  applied  for  the  period  of  price  stabilization  measures.  The  authorities  also  note  that  price declaration implies a statement of the new price, and not the submission of the calculation data.
