The  AIW  awards  importation  contracts, usually  for  one-year  periods,  through  competitive  tenders.

The AIW also imports agricultural inputs, mainly fertilizer blends and diothene sheeting (protective bags for bananas), for onward sale to farmers at subsidized prices; the same items may be freely imported by other companies. The AIW is entitled to import agricultural inputs duty free; the price subsidy, which it offers in onward trading, is financed only by profits made on bulk sugar imports and is not subject to Cabinet approval.', '47 Fair Trade Act No. 23 of 1999. 48 Price and Distribution of Goods Act, Cap. 161. 49 WTO document G/STR/N/6/VCT, 19 December 2000.', '\x0cWT/TPR/S/299 • Saint Vincent and the Grenadines', '- 363 -', '3.51.
