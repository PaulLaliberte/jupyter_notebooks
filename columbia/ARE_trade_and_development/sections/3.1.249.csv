For VAT, the Commission has set out a list of common rules in the VAT Directive that are applicable in each member State and harmonize certain elements such as rates and exemptions.56 It sets out minimum rates of 15% for the standard rate, and 5% for the reduced rate (applicable only  to  23  categories of  certain  goods  and  services specified  in the  VAT  Directive); thus  member States  apply  rates  equal  to  or  above  these  minima,  varying  by  product  and  member  State.  The Directive also allows for numerous derogations to these general rules on rates, applied by member States under certain conditions.', '3.52.

The system, known as EMCS, is an electronic system that documents and monitors the movement of excisable goods. Direct use of EMCS by economic operators requires an appropriate authorization. Authorizations, which allow for the suspension of the obligation to pay excise duty, are  governed  by  national  rules,  subject  to  the  general  provisions  of  Chapters  III  and  IV  of Directive 2008/118/EC.

According to information from the Commission,  Finland  charges  excise  duties  on  beverage  packages,  and  Germany  charges  an additional excise duty on alcoholic beverage blends.59 However, nearly all EU member States have many other excise duties on a wide variety of products and services, e.g. coffee, automobiles, and beverages  (Table  3.7).  There  are  currently  no  rules  or  plans  to  harmonize  these  other  excise duties  among  member  States.

Like the tariff, the CENVAT rates are also changed from time to time through notifications issued by the Government. The SAD is applied at a general rate of 4% which applies to almost the whole tariff (around 90%). It was introduced in 2006 to partially compensate for a range of taxes applied by the States, including sales tax, State value added tax and other charges. These charges vary from State to State and from product to product, but since the SAD is charged on imports at a flat rate of 4% it may not always be equivalent to these charges. In 2007 the Government notified the possibility to refund the SAD paid on imports subsequently sold in India and for which the importer had thus paid the relevant state sales and/or value  added  taxes.22  Imports  that  are  exempt  from  customs  duty,  either  through  an  exemption notification or by the tariff and the AD, are exempt from payment of the SAD as well.', '3.28.  In addition, India charges an Education Cess of 2% as well as a Higher Education Cess of 1%  on  the  aggregate  of  customs  duty  on  all  imports.  There  is  also  a  charge  for  the  National Calamity  Fund  for  goods  falling  under  the  Seventh  Schedule,  which  includes  tobacco  and  its products (specific duties or ad valorem duties of between 1% and 45%), petroleum oils and motor vehicles  (1%)  and  a  Clean  Energy  Cess  on  coal,  lignite  and  peat  of  Rs  200/metric  tonne  as  of 1 March  2015  (originally  introduced  at  Rs  50/MT  in  2010/11,  and  raised  to  Rs  100/MT  in 2013/14);  the  charge  on  these  products  is  exempted  from  the  equivalent  of  the  additional  duty payable.', '3.29.  The addition of these duties and charges to the applied tariff raises the actual duty paid by the importer significantly above the effective applied tariff rate. All imports, unless exempt, must pay the effective rate of customs duty, plus the AD, plus any cess applicable, and the Education and  Higher  Education  Cess;  the  4%  SAD  is  then  calculated  as  a  share  of  this  final  value.  As  a result, the overall average applied tariff including such charges rises from 13% to 28.3%, with the final duty charged for agricultural products (WTO definition) rising from 36.4% to 46.1% and for non-agricultural  products  from  9.5%  to  25.6%.  The  highest  overall  averages  are  found  in beverages (alcohol), spirits and tobacco (99.4%), coffee and tea (88%), and transport equipment (58.9%) (Table 3.5). Nevertheless, the authorities note that the final burden of duties borne by imported  goods  is  considerably  reduced  if  imported  for  further  manufacture  or  provision  of services. This is because the credit of these additional duties and charges is available to be set-off against  domestic  taxes  such  as  Central  Excise  Duty  and  Service  Tax  under  the  CENVAT  Credit Rules.
