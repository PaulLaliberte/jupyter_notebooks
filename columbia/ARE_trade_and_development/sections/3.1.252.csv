Indirect taxes on imports are an important source of income, since a considerable part of the goods consumed are imported. Although most imports receive national treatment with respect to  the  application  of  taxes,  there  are  a  few  instances  in  which  this  is  not  the  case.  During  the period  under  review,  St.  Kitts  and  Nevis,  together  with  other  OECS  states  introduced  a  value added tax and an excise tax; these replaced the consumption tax applied until October 2010. As part  of  its  Uruguay  Round  Schedule  of  Tariff  Concessions,  St.  Kitts  and  Nevis  bound  combined other  duties  and  charges  including  the  customs  service  charge,  the  consumption  tax,  and  any other applicable tax, at a general rate of 18%.', '3.33.  The consumption tax was applied on imports as well as domestic products and was ruled by the Consumption Tax (Amendment) Order, S.R.O: No. 4 of 2003. The general rates were 22.5% for  goods  and  4%  for  professional  services;  some  products  were  subject  to  higher  ad  valorem rates, while specific duties were levied on a few products such as tobacco, acetylene, and cement. The  tax  was  calculated,  in  the  case  of  imports  on  the  c.i.f.  value  plus  import  duties;  the consumption  tax  was levied  upon  importation  and collected  at  the  point  of  entry.  For  goods  the consumption  tax  was  calculated  on  the  ex-factory  price.
