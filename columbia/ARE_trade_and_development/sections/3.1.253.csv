During  the  period  under  review,  the  institutional  framework  for  standards  and  technical requirements  remained  largely  unchanged.  The  main  piece  of  legislation  is  the  Standards Organization of Nigeria Act, 2015; this Act repeals the old Standards Organization of Nigeria Act, 2004.  The  new  act  provides  additional  functions  for  the  Organization,  and  increases  penalties  for non-compliance.  The  enquiry  point  for  technical  barriers  to  trade  (TBT)  is  the  Standards Organization  of  Nigeria  (SON);  and  the  Federal  Ministry  of  Industry,  Trade  and  Investment  is responsible for notifications to the WTO.', '3.82.  Nigeria  submitted  three  notifications  to  the  WTO  in  the  period  from  January  2011  to November 2016  regarding  its technical  regulations  and  conformity  assessment  procedures.41  One of  the  notifications  informed  the  WTO  Members  that  Nigeria  was  developing  its  National  Quality Policy (since December 2014), and it provided Members 60 days to comment on the draft policy. Nigeria notified two measures on conformity assessment that are applied to locally produced and imported  goods,  respectively;  the  notified  measures  were  already  in  force  at  the  time  of notification. Nigeria did not notify any measures with regard to standards during the review period.', ""3.83.  Standards established by SON are called Nigerian  Industrial Standards (NIS). All standards in Nigeria are mandatory, i.e. technical regulations. Products currently covered include chemicals, civil engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, processed food, and textiles and leather.  All  Nigerian  technical  regulations  are  available  in  SON's  library.42  According  to  SON,  222 new  standards  have  been  established  since  January  2011,  covering,  inter  alia,  chemicals, electric/electronic  goods,  food,  mechanical  products,  textiles,  building  materials  and  civil engineering."", '3.84.  Nigerian industrial standards are established by consensus and approved by the Standards Council of SON. Eight Technical Groups support the Standards Directorate.43 At the national level, the Directorate coordinates the activities of the experts, relevant stakeholders and other interested parties on the National Technical Committees that develop the Nigerian Industrial Standards (NIS). According  to the  authorities,  when  formulating  an NIS,  Nigeria  will  consider adoption or  adaption of relevant international standards that already exist.

All goods (locally produced or imported) subject to technical regulations require conformity assessment  and  certification  before  they  are  placed  on  the  market,  under  the  Standards Organization  of  Nigeria  Conformity  Assessment  Programme  (SONCAP)44  for  imported  goods,  and under  the  Mandatory  Conformity  Assessment  Programme  (MANCAP)  for  domestically  produced goods.', '3.86.  Under  SONCAP,  all  imported  products  are  subject  to  pre-shipment  certification.  A  SONCAP Certificate  (SC)  is  a  mandatory  customs  clearance  document  in  Nigeria  and  imports  that  are  not accompanied by an SC will be denied entry. Exporters of goods to Nigeria must supply their local SON country office with a valid test report and photographs of the product they wish to export to Nigeria.45  Four  international  accreditation  firms  (IAFs)  operate  the  SONCAP  on  behalf  of  SON  for certification.46 An SC is required per container/per product, and  is valid for between six to twelve months.  It  is  reported  that  the  cost  of  a  SONCAP  procedure  amounts  to  some  US$600  per container/per product, and for mixed shipment (i.e. containing different products) the cost will be multiplied accordingly.', '3.87.  Similarly,  the  Mandatory  Conformity  Assessment  Programme  (MANCAP)  is  applied  to  all locally  manufactured  products.47  The  MANCAP  aims  to  ensure  that  all  locally  manufactured products  conform  to  the  relevant  NIS  before  being  presented  for  sale  in  Nigeria  or  exported.  A MANCAP  certificate  is  valid  for  three  years  after  which  the  product  must  undergo  recertification. The  MANCAP  logo  is  to  be  fixed  on  the  smallest  unit  pack  of  the  product  before  the  good  is introduced into the market for sale.', '3.88.  SON  also  operates  a  number  of  voluntary  certification  schemes,  including  the  Voluntary Product  Certification  Scheme  (NIS  Mark  of  Quality),  Nigerian  Quality  Award  Scheme  (NQA),  and Product-Type Certification for Exports.', '3.89.  Nigeria accepts test reports and certifications from laboratories in other countries as long as the  laboratory  is  accredited  to  ISO  17025.  However,  the  authorities  noted  that  inspection, sampling, and re-testing (when necessary) must be done at the SON Laboratory.', '3.90.  SON carries out enforcement operations through market surveillance and border inspections with Customs (for imports). SON may initiate market surveillance, or react to complaints. Products that are not compliant with NIS will be removed from markets, and/or are subject to rectification. SON publishes lists of products that have been blacklisted/destroyed, rectified, and ""downgraded"" on its own website.48 SON states that its enforcement activities are financed through rectification handling fees/fines.49', '3.91.
