It  was  necessary  in  March 2015  to  draw  up  an  inventory  of  all  standards  and  technical regulations in force in Madagascar, more particularly those affecting imports and exports, and to publish them officially on the Internet. This effort should be extended to all products potentially affecting human and animal health, safety, etc., such as foodstuffs, para-pharmaceuticals, tobacco products, cosmetics, products harmful to the environment, medical equipment, etc.', '3.79.  Such  an  inventory  would  pave  the  way  for  the  introduction,  to  the  extent  possible, of common  authorization  procedures  for  these  products,  and  this  would  eliminate  the  current overlapping  of  functions  mainly  as  regards  the  import  and  export  of  agrifood  products. Such streamlining  would  boost  trade  without  lessening  the  protection  of  domestic  and  foreign consumers - quite the contrary.', '3.80.  Apart  from  the  tests  carried  out  by  the  line  ministries  concerned  (agriculture,  livestock, forestry and fisheries), all food products or perishable items (including additives and sweetening matter) are also subject to two other procedures requiring two different laboratory tests.', '3.81.  A  review  should  be  made  of  national  quality  control  bodies  (standardization,  certification, inspection,  testing,  metrology)  in  order  to  separate  regulatory  power  more  clearly from national certification bodies or those responsible for enforcing standards, and to better circumscribe their respective roles. It is not infrequent today for mandatory standards to be promulgated by some regulatory  bodies  with  no  involvement  of  the  Madagascar  Bureau  of  Standards.  The  review', '35 WTO document G/TRIMS/N/2/Rev.8 of 19 July 2001.', '\x0cWT/TPR/S/318 • Madagascar', '- 59 -', 'of regulations would, amongst other things, enable all regulatory bodies to work hand-in-hand and to rely on the relevant standards when adopting technical regulations.', '3.82.  Besides, an effort should be made to create or strengthen internal coordination committees and other mechanisms – Madagascar has no National TBT Committee (technical barriers to trade), for example – in order to properly determine problems or risks associated with a given situation and  decide  whether  government  intervention  is  needed  and  the  type  of  measure  required, as appropriate.', '3.83.  There is no national accreditation body and no Malagasy entity is currently a member of the International  Laboratory  Accreditation  Cooperation  (ILAC).36  Madagascar  nonetheless  cooperates with  foreign  accreditation  bodies,  in  particular  the  French  Accreditation  Committee  (COFRAC), for the  accreditation  of  official  services  and/or  laboratories,  inter  alia,  so  as  to  ensure  that Malagasy products meet the international standards set by some importing countries.']"
