The objective of the PANAMÁ EXPORT programme is, inter alia, to assist companies with externalization  and  consists  of  promotion  and  marketing  technique  campaigns,  organization  of trade  fairs  and  missions,  training  programmes  and  upgrading  of  the  single  export  window.169 In 2012,  this  programme's  total  budget  amounted  to  B 925,979.  In  December 2012,  the  MICI launched  the  Panamaexport.gob.pa  website,  through  which  exporters  can  register  to  announce their products and services.170"", '3.191.  The purpose of the Agricultural Export Platforms is to diversify and increase the number of exporters and the value of agrifood exports to specific markets. It is aimed at companies in the agrifood sector (some 25 firms) which have no export experience or do not regularly export to the chosen market. The programme consists of three stages: training in export logistics; validation of the product (sending samples to the destination market, visits to potential buyers, suggestions for adapting the product, obtaining samples and prices for competing products); and in situ marketing (attendance at trade fairs and in trade missions, visits to supermarkets and distribution centres, and  meeting  with  potential  partners).  The  authorities  have  indicated  that  exports  from  the agroindustrial sector have performed positively, increasing from US$66 million in 2008 to around US$130 million in 2013.', ""3.192.  The Exporta Fácil programme is designed to facilitate the artisanal exports of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). It is a simplified export scheme using postal services and allows these companies to send goods up to a maximum weight of 30 kg per package and a value not exceeding US$5,000. The aim of this scheme is to improve efficiency and achieve low costs, as well as to offer competitive rates and the possibility of tracking dispatches. No customs broker is  required  for  export  formalities.  The  export  declaration  is  completed  on  the  Exporta  Fácil website171  and  sent  to  the  Posts  and  Telegraph  Office  (COTEL)  electronically.  The  goods  are deposited unwrapped at the offices of Exporta Fácil located in COTEL's branches, together with a copy  of  the  export  declaration  and  the  necessary  certificates  (origin,  sanitary  and  quality).172 The time-limits for dispatch of the goods by COTEL are 7 to 30 days. The first dispatches through Exporta Fácil took place in December 2011. The scheme is available in the provinces of Panama City,  Los  Santos,  Herrera  and  Coclé  and  will  gradually  be  extended  to  the  rest  of  Panama.173 To date, some 10 to 20 companies regularly use the Exporta Fácil scheme."", ""3.193.  The private sector is actively involved in promoting exports. APEX groups and represents exporters  from  all  economic  sectors  and  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  seeking  to externalize.174  Other  groups  of  exporters  include  the  Group  of  Exporters  of  Non-Traditional Agricultural  Products  of  Panama  (GANTRAP),  the  Seafood  Producers'  and  Exporters'  Association (APEXMAR)  and  SIP.  Representatives  of  APEX  and  SIP  belong  to  the  National  Commission  for International  Trade  Negotiations,  where  they  represent  the  interests  of  the  exporting  sector  in negotiations on trade agreements.""]"

Up  to  2012,  export  promotion  in  Botswana  fell  under  the  responsibility  of  the  Botswana Export  Development  and  Investment  Authority  (BEDIA).  In  2012,  BEDIA  and  the  Botswana International  Financial  Services  Centre  (IFSC)  were  merged  to  create  the  Botswana  Investment and  Trade  Centre  (BITC).  One  of  BEDIA's  mandates  was  to  identify  markets  for  locally manufactured  products  and  promote  Botswana  products  in  foreign  markets.73  BEDIA  conducted overseas market research aimed at finding export markets for Botswana-made products, including investigating  opportunities  in  markets  that  have  trade  agreements  with  Botswana,  so  as  to maximise  benefits.  Thereafter,  BEDIA  arranged  participation  in  regional  and  international exhibitions, and facilitated contacts between buyers and sellers."", ""3.77.

The  EDP  aims  at  increasing  exports  of  products  and  services  to  contribute  to  the diversification  of  the  economy  and  the  export  base  by  training  companies  to  become  exporters. The  goal  is  to  train  selected  companies  to  improve  product  design,  quality  and  productivity. Targeted  sectors  for  the  EDP  are  textiles  and  garments,  meat  and  meat  processing,  jewellery making, furniture, arts and crafts, services, leather and leather products, glass and glass products and chemicals. However, companies in other sectors will also be considered.74']"
