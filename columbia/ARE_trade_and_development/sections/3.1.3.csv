Tonga  has  no  national  standardization  body  or  dedicated  national  legislation  for  the adoption  of  standards  or  technical  regulations.  Although  the  Public  Health  Act  No.  19  of  2008 contains certain provisions authorizing the Minister for Health to define requirements, e.g. for food, motor vehicles (emission standards), and septic tanks, these provisions have so far not been used to establish any specific standards or technical regulations. Similarly, Consumer Protection Act No. 15  of  2000  authorizes  the  Minister  of  Commerce,  Tourism  and  Labour  to  prescribe  ""approved standards""  for  any  good  (Article  10).  Moreover,  Section  12(2)  of  Act  No.  26  of  2009,  which amends  the  Consumer  Protection  Act,  stipulates  that  ""if  a  good  is  or  contains  a  living  modified organism the approved standards applied to it shall comply with any standards or conditions set by the  National  Biosafety  Committee"".  Nevertheless,  no  such  standards  have  been  promulgated  to date.36', ""3.55.  The Ministry of Commerce, Tourism and Labour has been designated Tonga's National TBT notification authority and enquiry point. The Ministry intends to inform WTO Members promptly of any developments relevant to Tonga's obligations under the WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade.""]"
