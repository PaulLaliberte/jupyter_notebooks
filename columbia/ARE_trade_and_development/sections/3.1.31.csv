The Government has mostly harmonized its technical standards legislation with the relevant EU  Directives21,  as  this  is  an  important  requirement  the  former  Yugoslav  Republic  of  Macedonia has to fulfil in preparation for its EU accession negotiations. According to the authorities, on the basis of a strategy adopted in 2009, the country has achieved a high level of transposition of the European technical legislation into domestic legislation, related, inter alia, to the horizontal legal framework defining the competences between legislator, standardization, accreditation, metrology, conformity  assessment,  and  market  surveillance.  The  European  Commission\'s  latest  progress report  confirmed  that  ""good  progress  can  be  reported,  particularly  on  standardization, accreditation  and  metrology"".22  The  main  elements  of  the  legal  framework  for  standards  and technical  regulations  include:  Law  on  Standardization  (revised  in  2012),  2006  Law  on  Product Safety,  2009  Law  on  Accreditation,  2012  Law  on  Metrology,  and  Law  on  Market  Surveillance, together with various implementing decisions.23', ""3.66.  In addition to the Ministry of Economy, which is responsible for coordinating and transposing the acquis into the legal framework in this and other areas, other key institutions responsible for the framework governing the country's quality infrastructure are: (i) the Standardization Institute of the Republic of Macedonia (ISRM), which develops and adopts voluntary national standards and acts as the WTO enquiry point; (ii) the Accreditation Institute of the Republic of Macedonia (IARM), which  has  so  far  accredited  over  100  conformity  assessment  bodies  (including  laboratories  for testing  and  calibration,  and  organizations  issuing  product  certifications);  and  (iii)  the  Bureau  of Metrology, a legal entity within the Ministry of Economy, which was strengthened by amendments"", '21 The EU adopts Directives and publishes references to harmonized standards that each member state, and  a  prospective  member  like  the  former  Yugoslav  Republic  of  Macedonia,  is  required  to  transpose  into  its own legislation and national standards system.', '22 European Commission (2012), p.27 23  Amended  laws  notified  to  the  WTO  in  document  G/TBT/2/Add.84/Rev.1,  9  November  2012.

Until 2011, BOM issued permits for the import of measuring instruments.', '3.67.  The  ISRM  has  adopted  a  total  of  18,000  European  standards  (ENs),  96%  as  national standards,  of  which  4,000  are  harmonized  ENs  within  the  meaning  of  the  ""new  approach"" directives, which streamline technical harmonization and standards development covering essential safety, health, and environmental requirements. Over 4,000 international (ISO and IEC) standards have also been adopted.  All Yugoslav standards and conflicting standards have been withdrawn. The  ISRM  is  a  full  member  of  the  European  Committee  for  Standardization  (CEN)  and  of  the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC), and was certified in line with the EN ISO 9001:2009 standard.', '3.68.  Product certification is at an early stage of development. The Law on Product Safety (which needs  to  be  better  aligned  with  the  acquis  according  to  the  Commission)  lays  down  general product  safety  requirements,  the  manner  of  prescribing  technical  regulations,  and  principles  of mutual  recognition  of  the  documents,  conformity  assessment  procedures,  and  marks  of conformity.  According  to  the  authorities,  under  the  current  system,  conformity  with  technical requirements may be certified through a supplier declaration of conformity (1st party) or through a 3rd party certificate of conformity. Progress was achieved in 2012 through a Decree24 on a common framework for the marketing of products and notification of conformity assessment bodies to the European  Commission.  The  Decree  provides  general  obligations  for  economic  operators  and  a range of conformity assessment procedures, from which the appropriate approach can be selected.', ""3.69.  The Decree also provides for conformity assessment bodies (CABs) to be notified to the EU Commission  as  competent  to  carry  out  the  relevant  conformity  assessment  procedures.  The Ministry  of  Economy  has  designated  CABs,  inter  alia,  in  the  areas  of:  pressure  equipment, transportable  equipment,  lifts,  cableway  installation,  laboratory  testing  of  chemicals,  children's toys,  and  parts  relating  to  machinery  safety.  Other  ministries  responsible  for  designating  CABs are:  Transport  and  Communications,  for  aircraft  and  telecommunications  equipment;  Health,  for medical devices; and Environment for emission noise."", '3.70.  The  IARM  is  the  public  institution  that  issues  formal  accreditation  to  Macedonian  private sector laboratories, companies, and physical persons that meet standards required to participate in the  conformity  assessment  process.  The  IARM  has  so  far  accredited  107  conformity  assessment bodies  and  is  deemed  by  the  European  Commission  to  have  adequate  capacity  for  the  current scope of accreditations. The IARM is a member of  European co-operation for Accreditation (EA), and  in  2012  signed  the  multilateral  agreement  EA-MLA  (for  testing  and  calibration  laboratories, inspection  bodies,  and  product  certification  bodies),  to  facilitate  bilateral  trade;  it  also  signed  a mutual recognition agreement with the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC-MRA).', '3.71.  The  2010  Law  on  Market  Surveillance  contains  provisions  on  the  coordination  of  market surveillance of products on the market, on the control of products entering the market, and the implementation  of  general  principles  of  CE  marketing.  There  are  several  state  inspection authorities  including  the  State  Market  Inspectorate,  which  covers  most  standards  related  to consumer safety (e.g. technical products, low voltage products, textiles, footwear) in which most of the new approach directives have been transposed. The State Sanitary and Health Inspectorate, in accordance with the laws on Sanitary and Health Inspection and Safety of Cosmetic Products, inspects the safety of toys, cosmetics, and products for general use at the import, wholesale, and retail  stages.  The  market  surveillance  authorities  and  Customs  cooperate  to  identify  and  control specific products entering the market.', '3.72.  The  provisions  in  the  Food  Safety  Law  concerning  food  labelling  are  aligned  with  EU legislation,  according  to  the  authorities.  Labelling  requirements  (Box  3.2)  are  the  same  for domestic and imported foodstuffs except that on imports must display the address of the importer, place  of  origin,  and  country  from  which  the  product  is imported.  The  authorities  plan  to issue  a new rulebook by end-2013, by which EU Regulation 1169/2011 is to be transposed.', '24 Decree OG No. 56/2012 transposes EU Decision 768/2008.', '\x0cWT/TPR/S/290 • The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia', '- 50 -', 'Box 3.2 Labelling of food', 'The following particulars are compulsory on the labelling of foodstuffs:', '\uf0b7 \uf0b7 \uf0b7 \uf0b7 \uf0b7', '\uf0b7 \uf0b7 \uf0b7', '\uf0b7', '\uf0b7', '\uf0b7', 'name under which the product is sold; list of ingredients used in the production process; quantity of certain ingredients or categories of ingredients used in the production process; net quantity; date of minimum durability or, for foodstuffs that are highly perishable, from the microbiological point of view, the “use by” date; any special storage condition or conditions of use; lot No.; name or business name and address of the manufacturer or packager, or of a seller; imported products also require address of importer, place of origin, and country from which the product is being imported; particulars of the place of origin or provenance, where failure to give such particulars might mislead the consumer to a material degree as to the true origin or provenance of the foodstuffs; instructions for use when it would be impossible to make appropriate use of the foodstuff in the absence of such instructions; for beverages containing more than 1.2% by volume of alcohol, the actual alcoholic strength by volume.', 'Source:', 'Information provided by the authorities.']"
