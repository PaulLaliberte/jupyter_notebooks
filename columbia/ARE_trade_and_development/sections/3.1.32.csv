Registration  is  required  to  carry  out  business  activity  in  the  former  Yugoslav  Republic  of Macedonia.  A  trading  company  may  be  established  by  domestic  and  foreign  natural  and  legal persons  in  accordance  with  the  Law  on  Trade  Companies.  As  foreign  investors  are  granted  the same rights and privileges as Macedonian nationals, they are entitled to establish and operate all types of self-owned private companies or joint-stock companies.

Business  registration  is  governed  by  the  Law  on  Trade  Companies;  the  Law  on  One-Stop Shop  System;  the  Law  on  Administration  of  the  Trade  Register  and  the  Register  of  Other  Legal Entities,  and  the  Law  on  Central  Registry.  The  Macedonian  Central  Registry  keeps  the  Trade Register, comprising all legal persons in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.', ""3.64.  As a first step towards streamlining business registration, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  launched  a  central  registry  in  2006  after  a  2005  law  had  transferred  business registration out of the courts - where the process had been slow and overly complex - and made the registry the only body in the country responsible for registering companies. The government created a one-stop shop at the central registry, unifying and simplifying the procedures to register a company and its employees. This radically cut the number of procedures involved, and reduced the time from 48 days in 2004 to three, as measured by the World Bank. In 2011, the Government further  streamlined  and  reduced  the  cost  of  business  registration  through  an  online  system, removing  the  need  to  have  corporate  documents  and  signatures  notarized.  Due  to  this improvement in registry functioning, regarding starting a business, the country ranks sixth in the World  Bank's  Doing  Business  2012,  up  from  76th  position in  2007.  The  new  registry,  along  with legal  changes,  such  as  abolishing  the  minimum  capital  requirement,  has  enabled  the  former Yugoslav  Republic  of  Macedonia  to  join  the  ranks  of  the  world's  top  reformers  in  this  area  of business.  According  to  the  authorities,  the  proportion  of  applications  for  business  registration received through the online system is still limited.""]"
