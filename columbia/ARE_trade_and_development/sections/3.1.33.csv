Apart from the oil sector, at the federal level, the UAE has no taxes on income, wealth, or capital gains for individuals or corporations, although the authorities noted a full federal-level tax regime  is  under  study.  Oil  companies  pay  up  to  55%  tax  on  UAE-sourced  taxable  income  and royalties on production. At the emirate level, the Abu Dhabi Income Tax Decree of 1965, the Dubai Income Ordinance of 1969 and the Dubai Income Tax Decree, and the Sharjah Income Tax Decree of  1968  stipulate  that  each  corporate  body  doing  business  in  the  relevant  emirate  must  pay corporation tax according to the following income scale, although in practice this applies only to oil and gas companies and branches of foreign banks:', '\uf0b7 \uf0b7 \uf0b7 \uf0b7 \uf0b7 \uf0b7', 'less than or equal to Dh 1 million at 0%; between Dh 1 million and 2 million at 10%; between Dh 2 million and 3 million at 20%; between Dh 3 million and 4 million at 30%; between Dh 4 million and 5 million at 40%; and greater than Dh 5 million at 55%.', '3.80.  Municipality service charges are levied on individuals living and working in the UAE. Service charge percentages vary among the emirates. In Dubai, a service charge of 5 to 10% is charged on food purchased in hotels and restaurants. Furthermore, hotels charge a 10 to 15% market fee per  night  on  room  rates.  These  charges  are  usually  included  in  the  customer’s  bill,  which  the municipality collects from restaurants and hotels.', '3.81.  There are two options to establish a business in the UAE: outside or inside a free zone. The investment  regime  onshore  favours  local  over  foreign  investors.  All  investment  projects  have  to have 51% domestic capital meaning that these companies are allowed a maximum of 49% foreign ownership. Incentives are given to foreign investors in the free zones. Outside the free zones, no incentives  are  given,  although  the  ability  exists  to  purchase  property  as  freehold  in  certain predesignated areas in Dubai, which would appear to be an incentive aimed at attracting foreign investment.  As  noted  above,  the  Federal  Government  and  the  Governments  of  the  individual emirates promote a business environment largely free of taxation and exchange controls.', '3.82.  With the rise of Dubai as a regional hub for many international companies, one of the most successful policies has been the development of offshore free zones. Free zones contain financial incentives  to  establish  manufacturing  industries  in  the  UAE.

Free  zones  play  a  considerable  role  in  the  UAE  economy  since  two-thirds  of  the  non-oil products are exported from them, in particular machines and electronic devices. The UAE is home to nearly 40 free zones and economic specialized zones, all of which offer incentives to expatriate workers and investors. The highest concentration of free zones and economic specialized zones is in  Dubai  with  more  than  half  of  the  total  number  of  free  zones  (23,  out  of  which  14  are  free zones38),  followed  by  Abu  Dhabi  (5).  Specifically,  free  zone  regulations  permit  100%  foreign ownership,  compared  to  the  51%  UAE  citizen  ownership  required  outside  of  free  zones  under federal law – as well as tax, salary, and customs incentives for foreign investment and industry.', '3.84.  Free  zones  have  their  own  independent  authority  with  responsibility  for  licensing  and helping companies establish their business. Investors can register new companies in a free zone, or licensed branch or representative offices. Free zones have limited liability and are governed by the laws and regulations of free zones. Companies in free trade zones seeking to operate within the UAE may be governed by the new Commercial Companies Law, if the laws of the relevant free zone permit companies to operate outside of the free zones.', '3.85.  The most successful of the free zones is the Jebel Ali Free Zone (JAFZA) in Dubai, located 20 km south of Dubai city adjacent to the Jebel Ali Port. Over 6,000 companies representing 80 countries  have  set  up  businesses  in  JAFZA,  including  numerous  Fortune  500  firms.  The  JAFZA managing  authority  authorizes  five  types  of  licence:  a  trading  licence  for  specific  activities;  a general trading licence (to trade in multiple commodities allowable under the permitted activities); an  industrial  licence;  a  national  industrial  licence;  and  a  service  licence.  The  licences  are  valid while a company holds a current lease in the free zone authority and are renewable annually as long as the lease is in force. Entities licensed in the free zone can be in the form of a free zone company,  a  free  zone  establishment,  or  a  branch  of  a  local  or  foreign  company.  The  licence  is issued  for  any  activity  permitted  by  the  free  zone  authority,  including  manufacturing.  A  JAFZA-licensed company can only operate in JAFZA or outside the UAE, but business can be undertaken and sales made in the UAE through or to a company holding a valid Dubai Economic Department licence. However, a JAFZA-licensed company can purchase goods or services from within the UAE.', '3.86.  A variety of innovative free zones have been established in Dubai since 2000, most notably the  Dubai  Creative  Cluster  free  zone  (previously  known  as  TECOM  –  Technology,  Electronic Commerce and Media free zone). The Dubai Creative Cluster houses both Internet City and Media City, two subdivisions which cater for the information technology and media sectors respectively. Dubai Creative Cluster offers a high bandwidth and state-of-the-art IT infrastructure. Other Dubai free  zones  include  the  Dubai  Multi  Commodities  Centre  (DMCC),  with  over  8,000  licensed businesses  trading  across  a  range  of  commodities  including  gold,  diamonds,  pearls,  precious metals,  and  tea;  and  Dubai  Healthcare  City,  specializing  in  medical  products  and  services.
