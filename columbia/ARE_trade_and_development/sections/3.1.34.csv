In  order  to  operate  in  Swaziland,  all  businesses  must  be  registered  and  licensed  by  the Ministry  of  Commerce,  Industry  and  Trade  (MCIT)  under  the  Trading  Licences  Order  No.  20  of 1975 and the Trading Licences Amendment Act No. 9 of 2011 (the latter enables applications for trading licences to be advertised within three working days instead of 21 days).1 Any individual or company engaged in importing and/or exporting goods requires a trading licence. In addition, any person  wishing  to  engage  in  importing,  exporting  or  transiting  certain  controlled  agricultural products  (""scheduled  agricultural  products"")  must  register  with,  and  obtain  a  permit  from,  the National Agricultural Marketing Board under the NAMBOARD Act No. 13 of 1985 (Section 3.1.3).', '3.2.  For customs clearance purposes, importers (and exporters) must register with the Swaziland Revenue  Authority  (SRA),  established  in  2011.2  Customs  clearance  is  mostly  done  through customs agents, who must be licensed by the SRA; although some companies rely on their own import-export units. Documentation required for custom clearance includes: the import declaration using the single administrative document (SAD 500) and supporting documents such as the bill of lading, invoice, road manifest and packaging list. In some instances, certificates of origin, import permits, and SPS certificates may also be required.', '3.3.  Goods  may  be  cleared  within  seven  days  of  the  date  of  importation  under  one  of  four customs procedures: home use, temporary admission, transit or warehousing (in this case, they will  remain  stored  in  bond  until  the  importer  enters  them  for  home  use  or  re-export).  These procedures are governed by the Swaziland Customs and Excise Act and the Customs Regulations.', ""3.4.  Goods  imported  into  Swaziland  from  outside  SACU  are  liable  to  import  duty  and,  for  some types of goods, also excise duty. Value added tax (VAT) is payable on all imports, including from SACU. Given Swaziland's condition as a landlocked country, most of its overseas imports arrive via the port of Durban (South Africa) and from there are transported by road or rail to Swaziland.3 An alternative route for Swazi imports is through the port of Maputo (Mozambique), which is closer than Durban, but road infrastructure is suboptimal.4 In addition, Swaziland has an inland dry port at the Matsapha Industrial Estate, where customs clearance can be conducted."", '3.5.  Imports into Swaziland from other SACU countries are cleared for VAT collection purposes at land  borders,  the  international  airport,  the  parcel  post,  or  the  railway  station.  No  import  duties apply on these goods.', ""3.6.  Since  the  last  Review,  Swaziland  has  made  progress  towards  customs  automation  by completing the roll out of ASYCUDA++ in 2009. Importers (and exporters) are required to lodge customs declarations electronically through ASYCUDA++. The function of capturing data has been outsourced to a private company, which charges a fee of E 35.00 per each declaration. Customs data  may  be  captured  at  the  border  post,  airport  or  any  of  the  Customs  Clearance  Offices. Alternatively, since 2011, data may be lodged by remote connection at the trader's own premises through the so-called Direct Trader Input (DTI). In order to use the DTI, traders must register with ASYCUDA  (tax  clearance  certificate,  trading  licence  and  contact  details  are  required).  However,"", '1 Under the Trading Licences Order of 1975, an application is submitted to the MCIT, which places an', 'advertisement in the media and sets a date for a hearing at which the applicant presents the Memorandum and Articles of Association, a bank statement, a tax clearance certificate and other relevant documents. The advertising fee is E 50.00. The trade licence must be renewed annually. The renewal does not involve the advertisement and hearing. Food sellers are required to produce health certification. Requirements for obtaining different types of trading licences are found on the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Trade website at: http://www.gov.sz/index.php?option=com_content&id=378&Itemid=184.', '2 The SRA was established with the introduction of the VAT system. It results from the merger of the', 'previous revenue services (Customs and Inland Revenue) and has a new organizational structure and powers.', '3 For imports transiting by road, a security bond must be lodged. This is not required for goods', 'transported by rail given the very low likelihood that they would be diverted for use in the South African market.', '4 Maputo serves mainly as a transit port for Swazi exports of sugar and iron ore.

Swaziland  is  using  an  automated  risk  management  system  under  ASYCUDA++  that  covers the entire declaration-processing path, including cargo and transit. It uses sophisticated tools to select  the  examination  procedures  and  allocate  the  declared  goods  to  a  control  channel:  green (release of goods without examination); yellow (documentary checks prior to goods release); red (physical examination of goods prior to release); or blue (goods are released but subjected to a post-clearance audit). The system allows for periodic assessment of risk management processes in order  to  measure  the  effectiveness  of  selection  criteria  and  change,  extend  or  eliminate  risk management  parameters  as  needed.  The  authorities  indicated  that  the  information  on  the proportion of declarations going through each selection channel was not available.', '3.8.  According to a time release study conducted by the authorities in 2012, average processing times  for  exports  and  imports  vary  depending  on  the  border  post.  The  results  pertaining  to  the three main border stations are presented in Table 3.1.', 'Table 3.1 Average processing times at selected border posts, February 2012 Border post Ngwenya Lomahasha Lavumisa', 'Imports 3 hours 30 minutes 1 hour 50 minutes 1 hour 5 minutes', 'Exports 45 minutes 1 hour 12 minutes 1 hour 20 minutes', 'Source:  SRA, Time Release Study Report, Swaziland, February 2012. Report provided by the authorities.', ""3.9.  The World Bank Doing Business Report 2015 indicates that in Swaziland customs clearance and inspection for imports takes three days. Overall, import procedures take on average 23 days and represent a cost of US$2,245 per container; this ranks Swaziland 127 out of 189 economies as regards  trading  across  borders.5  Some  of  the  frequent  complaints  voiced  by  the  private  sector regarding  cross-border  trade  are:  delays  in  service  delivery,  insufficient  staff  at  the  border,  the duplication  of  documentation,  the  lack  of  a  database  to  evaluate  goods,  and  the  lack  of  a  fully automated declaration system linking Swaziland's borders.6"", ""3.10.  Aggrieved importers/exporters may appeal against customs decisions to the Commissioner General (CG) of the Swaziland Revenue Authority (SRA), and appeals against the SRA's decisions may  be  heard  in  the  courts.  Under  section  91  of  the  Customs  and  Excise  Act,  an  importer  or exporter can voluntarily choose to have a case dealt with administratively by the CG to avoid legal proceedings. This means, however, forgoing the right to challenge the CG's decision in court."", '3.11.  Swaziland  has  been  a  member  of  the  World  Customs  Organization  (WCO)  since 15 May 1981, and it became a party to the Revised Kyoto Convention on 31 October 2012, when it deposited its instrument of accession.', '3.12.  During  the  period  under  review,  Swaziland  undertook  a  number  of  reforms  to  facilitate trade. These include the modernization of customs procedures as a result of the establishment of the SRA (2011); the gradual implementation of an electronic data interchange system for customs at  border  posts;  the  decentralization  and  streamlining  of  the  issuance  of  certificates  of  origin (2012); the extension of border operation times; the upgrading of border posts; and initiatives to facilitate  VAT  payment  across  borders.  A  National  Working  Group  on  Trade  Facilitation  was established  in  2008  to  coordinate  work  relating  to  trade  facilitation  in  the  WTO;  the  group  is composed of key government and private sector stakeholders.', '3.13.  Based on the findings of the time release study of 2012, the SRA established a prioritized action  plan  to  modernize  customs.  One  of  the  main  ongoing  projects  is  the  migration  from ASYCUDA++ to the more comprehensive and efficient ASYCUDA World system, which will improve customs clearance and data collection. At the time of writing this report, migration was expected to take place in September 2015.', '5 World Bank (2014). 6 Speech by Zodwa Mabuza, CEO of the Federation of Swaziland Employers and Chamber of Commerce,', 'at the launch of the Swaziland-World Bank Time Release Study, 24 January 2012.', '\x0cWT/TPR/S/324 • Swaziland', '- 381 -', ""3.14.  Another  significant  step  is  the  implementation  of  a  VAT  refund  administration  scheme, whereby importers of goods into Swaziland from South Africa, who present a valid South African tax invoice at any designated commercial border post, do not have to pay for VAT in cash at entry into  Swaziland,  as  the  SRA  will  claim  the  VAT  refund  directly  from  the  South  African  Revenue Service  (SARS).  The  VAT  refund  system  was  successfully  implemented  on  1  April  2015  at six border posts.7 It is expected to increase Swaziland's revenue, reduce waiting times at border crossings, and help alleviate traders' cash flow shortages."", ""3.15.  The  Swaziland  Revenue  Authority  is  also  working  on  the  establishment  of  a  trade  data exchange system with SARS, which should help reduce under-declaration by importers (and ghost exports),  resulting  in  more  revenue  for  Swaziland  and  less  discrepancies  in  bilateral  trade  data. There is also a pilot project for a preferred trader programme (PTP) that would grant preferential treatment to traders on the basis of their level of customs compliance and the risk associated with their  operations  (Main  Report,  Section  3.2).  Other  projects  include  work  on  reducing  trade documentation and setting up a single window for trade, incorporating other agencies' processes, in  particular  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture;  the  development  of  a  trade  portal;  and  provision  of e-training for customs clearance agents."", '3.16.  Another objective of the customs modernization programme is redrafting customs legislation in  order  to  bring  customs  control  in  line  with  the  recommendations  of  the  WCO  Revised  Kyoto Convention and incorporate trade facilitation provisions. The redrafted legislation is based on the SACU models and will consist of two Acts: the Customs Control and Duty Act and the Excise Duty Act. The authorities could not indicate when the bills will be submitted to Parliament.', '3.17.  As  of  end-June  2015,  Swaziland  had  not  yet  submitted  to  the  WTO  its  Category  A notifications under the new Trade Facilitation Agreement.', '3.18.  In 2007, Swaziland notified the WTO that it was implementing the WTO Customs Valuation Agreement  under  Part  IX  of  its  Customs  and  Excise  Act  No.  21  of  1971.8  Customs  valuation  is among the trade measures that have been harmonized within SACU.']"
