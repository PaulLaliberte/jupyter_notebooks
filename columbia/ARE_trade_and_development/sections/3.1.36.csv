December 2014 saw a significant reform of Morocco's legislative and regulatory framework for  industrial  property  following  the  publication  of  Law  No. 23-13  amending  and  supplementing Law  No. 17-97,  already  amended  in  2006.165  The  aim  of  the  new  reform  is  to  consolidate  the national  trademark  system,  improve  the  patent  system,  modernize  the  national  system  for industrial  designs,  step  up  enforcement  of  industrial  property  rights,  and  streamline  application procedures  for  industrial  property  rights  by  creating,  among  other  things,  an  electronic  filing service for applications and shortening the time-limits for opposition."", '3.185.  Law  No. 17-97  protects  trademarks  or  service  marks  consisting  of  denominations  of  all kinds,  as  well  as  figurative  signs  and,  following  the  adoption  of  Law  No. 31-05,  also  sounds  or olfactory  marks.  Ownership  of  a  trademark  is  acquired  through  its  effective  registration  and remains valid for a period of ten years, renewable indefinitely. Trademark holders may lose their rights  if  they  do  not  make  ""proper""  use  of  the  mark  for  a  period  of  five  years.  Law  No. 23-13 provides  for  the  introduction  of  a  system  for  dividing  applications  to  register  trademarks  in conformity with the Singapore Treaty and reduction of the time-limit for filing the documents from four to three months.', ""3.186.  The main novelty as far as patents is concerned has been the introduction of a system for examining  applications  according  to  patentability  criteria  (novelty,  inventive  step  and  industrial application).  The  OMPIC  is  responsible  for  preparing  a  search  report  giving  an  opinion  on  the product's patentability."", '3.187.  In order to achieve a balance between the interests of inventors and those of third parties, the  new  Law  introduces  exceptions  to  the  rights  conferred  by  a  patent.  In  addition  to  the provisions already to be found in Law No. 17-97, which allowed compulsory or ex officio licensing in  special  situations  (excessively  high  prices,  shortages  on  the  domestic  market,  public  health interests)  for  patents  for  medicines  by  means  of  an  administrative  act,  the  so-called  ""Bolar"" provision authorizes use of a patent in connection with studies or trials required in order to obtain a  marketing  authorization.  These  measures  have  been  extended  to  exports  to  countries  whose production capacity is insufficient.', '3.188.  Pursuant  to  Law  No. 17-97  (as  amended),  the  term  of  patent  protection  is  20 years.166 Law No. 31-05  provides  for  extending  the  term  for  medicines  if  there  are  delays  in  issuing  the patent or the AMM. Compulsory licences may also be requested three years after the issue of a patent or four years after the date of filing the application if the owner has not started to work the invention,  has  not  marketed  the  product  or  has  given  up  working  or  marketing  the  patent  in', 'Tourism and Crafts (Directorate for Protection of the National Heritage, Innovation and Promotion); and OMPIC.', '165 Law No. 31-05 amending and supplementing Law No. 17-97 on the protection of industrial property,', 'enacted by Dahir No. 1-05-190 of 14 February 2006; and Decree No. 2-05-1485 of 20 February 2006 amending and supplementing Decree No. 2-00-368 of 7 June 2004 implementing Law No. 17-97 on the protection of industrial property.', '166 Decree No. 2-00-368 of 7 June 2004 implementing Law No. 17-97 on the protection of industrial', 'property.', '\x0cWT/TPR/S/329 • Kingdom of Morocco', '- 83 -', 'Morocco for more than three years. Ex officio licences to work a patent may be granted for reasons of public health167 or national defence.', '3.189.  The term of protection for layout-designs of integrated circuits is ten years. Law No. 23-13 introduces a change to the length of renewal of the term for industrial designs for four additional successive  periods  of  five  years  each,  giving  a  total  term  of  protection  of  25  years  instead  of 15 years  as  previously.  As  regards  the  protection  of  trade  names,  Law  No. 17-97  refers  to  the provisions of Law No. 15-95 (Commercial Code).168 It also prohibits the use of false or misleading indications concerning the origin of a product or service, the identity of the producer, manufacturer or trader, and punishes use of a false or misleading appellation of origin or its imitation.', '3.190.  Law No. 25-06 on distinctive signs of origin and quality of foodstuffs and agricultural and fishery  products  was  enacted  in  June 2008169  and  came  into  force  upon  publication  of  its implementing  texts  in  December  of  that  year.170  It  supplements  Law  No. 17-97  (as  amended), which established the register of geographical indications at the OMPIC. Law No. 25-06 created a legal  framework  for  the  recognition  and  protection  of  the  specific  quality  of  agrifood  products, particularly local products (Section 3.3.5) and determines the relevant sanctions. It also provides for  the  establishment  of  the  National  Commission  on  Distinctive  Signs  of  Origin  and  Quality.  It does not cover wines and spirits, which remain subject to the former regulations dating from 1977.', ""3.191.  In  the  case  of  trademarks,  the  penal  sanctions  include  terms  of  imprisonment  of two months  to  one  year  and  fines  ranging  from  DH 50,000  to  DH  1,000,000.  The  system  of opposition established by Law No. 31-05 in 2006 has been consolidated with the new provisions in Law  No. 23-13,  which  include  the  introduction  of  a  system  for  rejecting  applications  to  register trademarks  on  absolute  grounds.  For  example,  in  a  reasoned  decision,  the  OMPIC  may  refuse applications to register trademarks if it considers that the sign has no distinctive character or is likely  to  mislead  the  public  as  to  the  nature,  quality  or  geographical  origin  of  the  product  or service.  The  holder  of  an  exclusive  exploitation  licence  also  has  the  right  of  opposition,  unless otherwise stipulated in the licensing agreement. Appeals may be made to the Commercial Court of Appeal  against  the  OMPIC's  decisions.  In  2014,  the  OMPIC  received  898  requests  opposing  the registration of trademarks, compared to 737 in 2013, i.e. a 22% increase."", '3.192.  Any  infringement  of  patent  rights  is  liable  to  civil  and  penal  sanctions  ranging  from  civil proceedings with a view to terminating the illegal acts and the payment of damages, to a term of imprisonment of two months to two years, and a fine of DH 50,000 to DH 500,000. If the offence is repeated, the penalties may be doubled and the term of imprisonment may be up to five years if the  infringement  affects  national  defence.  The  commercial  courts  have  sole  competence  to  hear proceedings  resulting  from  application  of  the  law,  with  the  exception  of  certain  administrative decisions. Their rulings may be appealed before the Commercial Court of Appeal, whose decisions in turn may be the subject of a final appeal to the Supreme Court.171', '3.193.  Law  No. 17-97  imposes  sanctions  against  any  disclosure  of  information  relating  to  an invention, and the penalties include fines of up to DH 500,000 and a term of imprisonment of up to two years.', '3.194.
