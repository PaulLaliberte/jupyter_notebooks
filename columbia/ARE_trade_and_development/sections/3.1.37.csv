As notified to the WTO, over the period 2009-2013 Chile did not grant any export subsidies for  agricultural  products.116  Nevertheless,  in  order  to  promote  its  exports,  Chile  still  offers exporters tariff and tax concessions.', '3.124.  Exporters can usually obtain the reimbursement of the customs duties and other taxes paid on the import of raw materials, semi-processed goods, components or spare parts if these inputs are incorporated into or used to manufacture the goods exported.117 Exporters taking advantage of this benefit may not, for the same product, be eligible for the simplified drawback system for taxes on  non-traditional  minor  exports.  Between  January 2009  and  December 2014,  Chile  refunded US$121 million under the general drawback system.118', '3.125.  Chile  still  applies  the  simplified  drawback  system  for  taxes  on  non-traditional  minor exports.119 Under this system, non-traditional exports containing at least 50% of imported inputs are  eligible  for  reimbursement  of  3%  of  the  f.o.b.  value  of  the  goods  exported.  Each  year, the MEFT publishes the list of products not eligible for this programme and the maximum amount of the value of exports, by tariff heading, that may benefit from drawback.120 The two drawback systems remain in place, as the procedures for obtaining reimbursement are more straightforward under the simplified system. The general law on drawback requires full accounting records and this is  complicated  for  small  companies,  which  therefore  prefer  the  simplified  system.  The  amount reimbursed  under  the  simplified  system  did  not  change  to  any  great  extent  during  the  period under  review,  ranging  from  US$2.61 million  in  2010  and  US$4.56 million,  reaching  a  total  of US$20.59 million over the period 2009-2014 (up to 31 October).', '3.126.  In  addition  to  these  tariff  concessions,  the  temporary  admission  for  inward  processing regime  (DATPA)121  allows  companies  producing  goods  for  export  to  import  raw  materials, semi-processed goods and components and spare parts from abroad without paying import duties or other taxes or VAT.
