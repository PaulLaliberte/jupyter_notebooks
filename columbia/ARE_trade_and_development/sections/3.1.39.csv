Cabo Verde  submitted  a  notification  to  the  WTO  Committee  on  Import  Licensing  in  2009, outlining the import regime established further to the Decree-Law No. 68/2005.38 A non-automatic licensing  regime  is  applied  to  goods  subject  to  sanitary  or  phytosanitary  controls,  security measures  (e.g.  handguns  and  explosives),  or  other  mandatory  restrictions  required  by  Law. In addition  to  the  non-automatic  licence,  a  certificate  of  compliance  may  be  required  from  the sanitary/phytosanitary authorities, or other competent authorities depending on the nature of the goods.  Non-automatic  licences  are  to  be  issued  within  21  days  from  the  date  the  customs declaration is presented to the competent authorities.39 A non-automatic licence is issued for each transaction, and is normally valid for the period requested by the importer.40 Import licences for arms  and  other  security  products  are  valid  for  90  days  and  may  exceptionally  be  extended  for another 60 days. A screening process of the importers is also in place.', '3.43.  An automatic licensing regime is applied to all other imports, except those totally exempt from  licensing.  The  automatic  licence  becomes  effective  as  goods  are  declared  to  customs,  and does  not  require  the  completion  of  any  form  or  the  provision  of  any  specific  information. Since licences are issued automatically as goods are cleared through customs, the licences carry no term of validity. Goods totally exempt from licensing include goods ""without commercial value"" or  ""without  expenditure  of  currency"";  goods  in  transit,  temporarily  imported,  re-imported  or re-exported; goods subject to special customs regimes such as franc stores, franc deposits, special customs storage or bonded warehouses; manufactured products for use in international trade fairs and  exhibitions,  etc.;  goods  for  the  supply  or  exclusive  use  of  air  and  maritime  navigation companies;  and  goods  that  have  been  apprehended,  abandoned,  found  or  salvaged  from shipwrecks, and subsequently sold at auction.', '3.44.  The ECOWAS Treaty calls for relaxation and gradual removal of quantitative restrictions in intra-community trade (Article 41). However, having informed the Executive Secretary of ECOWAS and  the  other  ECOWAS  member  States,  any  ECOWAS  member  may  impose  restrictions  or prohibitions based on (i) the application of security laws and regulations; (ii) the control of arms, ammunition, and other war equipment and military items; (iii) the protection of human, animal or plant  health  and  life,  or  the  protection  of  public  morality;  (iv)  the  transfer  of  gold,  silver,  and precious  and  semi-precious  stones;  (v)  the  protection  of  national  artistic  and  cultural  property; (vi) the  control  of  narcotics,  hazardous  and  toxic  wastes,  nuclear  or  radioactive  materials;  and (vii) products  and  materials  used  in  the  development  or  exploitation  of  nuclear  energy.

Subsequently, the product coverage was reduced somewhat in 2011 (Circular No. 32/2011/TT-BCT of  5  September  2011).34  A  temporary  suspension  was in  2012  (Circular No. 27/2012/TT-BCT  of  26 September  2012).

Licences are valid for 30 days from the date of issue, and are not transferable among importers. Importers must apply for a new licence when the old  licence  has  expired.

Except  for  eggs  and  some  agricultural products  produced  in  commercial  quantities,  licensing  is  automatic.  There  is  no  provision  for administrative discretion as to the list of goods that appear in the SRO's different schedules.

In  this  case,  the  Supply Office  was  required  to  notify  the  major  importers  of  their  allocated  quotas,  and  import  licences could be refused if there was abundant domestic production.34 The overall quota was determined by  the  level  of  domestic  production,  but  individual  quotas  were  allocated  based  on  the  import', '31 The products subject to quantitative restrictions were: aerated beverages (2202.101), waters; other', 'waters (201.10), beer (22.03), malt (2202.90.20), candles/paraffin wax (34.06), curry powder (0910.50), pasta (19.02), animal feed (23.09), wooden furniture (9401.60 /9403.60), solar water heaters (8419.19), and industrial gases/oxygen, carbon dioxide, acetylene (2804.40, 2811.21, 2901.292).

Import  restrictions  apply  on  a  number  of  products  for  safety,  health  and  environmental reasons; and in some cases for infant industry protection. Under the Import Control Order of 1976, the Import Control Regulations of 1980 and Legal Notice No. 60 of 2000, the following products from outside the SACU customs union are subject to prior import permits: arms; drugs; mineral fuels; mineral oils; gold and other precious metals; specified agricultural products (wheat, wheat flour,  dairy  products,  maize  and  rice);  electrical  appliances;  automotive  parts;  used  motor vehicles11;  used  earthmoving  equipment;  used  tyres  and  tyre  castings;  used  clothing;  used footwear;  used  textiles;  and  wild  animal  products.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  issues  the  import permits  for  the  products  listed  above.  Any  person,  company  or  non-commercial  institution  may apply for a permit. Applications and attendant documents are submitted to the principal Secretary of the Ministry of Finance12, and are examined by the Import Permit Committee (IPC), chaired by the  Ministry  of  Finance.13  Import  permits  are  valid  for  one  year  and  must  not  be  transferred, negotiated, sold or used by any person other than the person named in the permit.', '3.31.

Currently,  a  number  of  agricultural  goods  are  subject  to  import  levies  (Section  3.1.2).  These measures  are  determined  taking  into  account  the  availability  of  local  production  and  their  main purpose is to protect local farmers and help develop agricultural production in Swaziland.', '3.34.  In  addition,  under  the  Dairy  Act  of  1968  and  the  Animal  Diseases  Act  of  1965,  the Swaziland Dairy Board (SDB) issues import permits (and charges levies) for all scheduled imported dairy  products  (Section  3.1.2).  The  purpose  of  these  measures  is  to  protect  human  and  animal health as well as the local dairy industry. These requirements are to be reviewed periodically to determine the stage of development of the national dairy industry as well as possible human and animal health risks. Where amendments are deemed necessary, consultations are undertaken with the Dairy Industry Stakeholder Coordinating Committee, comprising representatives of consumers, retailers,  producers  and  government  officials.  The  representatives  are  given  90  days  to  make submissions  regarding  possible  changes  to  the  regulations.  Importers  who  have  been  refused  a permit may initiate an appeal process; this is initiated before the SDB permit office and may end up at a court of law.', ""11 Except motor vehicles older than 15 years, whose importation is prohibited. 12 Requirements and conditions for application can be found at the Ministry of Finance's website.
