Since  2009, there  has  been  no  major  change  in  the  requirements  for importing  goods  into Maldives.  The  main  documents  required  for  customs  clearance  include:  the  import  licence;  the declaration form; the original commercial invoice; the packing list; and the bill of lading or airway bill.  Other  documents,  such  as  a  sanitary  and  phytosanitary  certificate  or  a  certificate  of  origin, may be required where applicable. Additional documents are required for food imports.1', '3.9.  It  is  not  mandatory  to  use  the  services  of  a  licensed  customs  broker  for  the  clearance  of commercial imports, although the majority of businesses have recourse to one. The profession is restricted to individuals trained by the Maldives Customs Service (MCS) and holding a licence. As of July 2015, there were 52 licensed customs brokers. Customs brokers pay a registration fee of Rf 500 and an annual licence fee of Rf 3,500.', ""3.10.  The  enforcement  of  border  protection  laws,  including  customs  procedures,  is  under  the responsibility  of  the  MCS,  which  has  nine  regional  offices  located  across  the  country.  In  2013, nearly 90% of imports were cleared in the Male region (Male's commercial harbour, the Ibrahim Nasir International Airport, or the post office)."", '3.11.

Since  January  2000,  Maldives  has  been  using  the  ASYCUDA++  version  of  the  Automated System for Customs Data for its customs administration. Migration to ASYCUDA World is expected to  be  completed  by  mid-2016.2  Registered  traders  may  submit  their  declarations  to  the  system through the Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) or the Direct Trade Input (DTI). Maldives is in the process of establishing a paperless trading environment and, as such, the requirement to submit paper  copies  has  been  abolished.  As  of  end-October  2015,  approximately  50%  of  declarations submitted that year were lodged online. According to estimates from the MCS, customs procedures (from the lodgement of the declaration to the release of the cargo) take on average two days for shipments  arriving  through  the  airport,  and  five  days  for  shipments  arriving  through  the commercial harbour.', '3.13.  As part of efforts to establish a paperless trading environment, the authorities are working towards  the  development  of  a  Single  Window  for  trade  facilitation.  The  legal  framework  is expected to be in place by end-2015. Obtaining the needed funding to support other agencies in the automatization of their processes is indicated by the authorities as the main challenge.', ""1 Maldives Food and Drug Authority's (MFDA) announcement No. IUL 23-AP/01/2010/252 clarifies"", 'documentation requirements for food imports.

Maldives does not require a preshipment inspection.3 Physical examination is carried out on a  risk-assessment  basis.  High-risk  items  include:  products  with  a  misclassification  history; products subject to restrictions and controls; duty exempted goods; and products that are subject to high duty rates. A database on such products is maintained internally by the MCS. In general, perishable items are less likely to be inspected. Approximately 25% to 30% of consignments are physically inspected.', ""3.15.  In  2013,  the  MCS  introduced  a  fast  clearance  channel  with  a  view  to  providing  a  more convenient and speedier service for eligible importers and exporters. The eligibility is based on the trader's compliance history and the nature of the consignment. Low value and low duty rate items are  generally  eligible.  The  channel  includes:  an  express  service  for  document  processing (declarations are not checked in detail); a customs portal and information kiosks, allowing traders to  check  the  status  of  their  declaration  and  submit  additional  documentation  online;  and  a pre-payment  system,  enabling  traders  to  make  online  payments  and  request  release order/selectivity  immediately  thereafter.  According  to  the  authorities,  goods  eligible  for  the  fast clearance  channel  can  be  cleared  in  less  than  three  hours.  Other  trade  facilitating  measures include  a  pre-arrival  declaration  processing  service;  an  online  manifest  submission  system;  a simplified customs declaration process for individuals; and the possibility of deferred payment for perishable cargo (for eligible traders)."", '3.16.  Despite these trade facilitation initiatives, delays in the processing and clearance of goods are  still  relatively  high.

Documentary  compliance  for  imports  takes  an  estimated  average  of  61 hours.  The authorities  are  of  the  view  that  these  indicators  do  not  accurately  reflect  the  situation.  Time release studies by the MCS concluded an average of two to five days (although this does not cover port/airport delays).', '3.17.  Maldives is a member of the World Customs Organization.
