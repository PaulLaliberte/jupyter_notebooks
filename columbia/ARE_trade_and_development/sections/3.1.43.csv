Since its last Review, Pakistan has not notified the WTO of any subsidy within the meaning of  the  Agreement  on  Subsidies  and  Countervailing  Measures,  nor  any  subsidy  that  operated directly  or  indirectly  to  increase  exports  from  or  reduce  imports  into  its  territory  within  the meaning of Article XVI:1 of GATT 1994. Direct export assistance is financed through the EMDF61, which is fully funded from the Export Development Surcharge charged to exporters at 0.25% of the f.o.b. value of shipments.62 Collections from the surcharge generated over PRs 5 billion from 2010  to  2014.  Exports  benefit  from  income  tax  concessions  with  exporters  paying  1%  income withholding tax instead of income tax. Exports are exempt from Sales Tax. While the tax base of gross  f.o.b.  receipts  substantially  exceeds  taxable  net  income  on  which  company  tax  would  be levied, the difference in tax rates (company tax rate of 35%) suggests possible sizeable subsidies for profitable exporters.', '3.68.

A number of other facilities are provided to exporters, for example the use of common warehouses, payments of commission to agents, subsidies for the opening of offices abroad, duty drawback and marketing assistance.67 In the context of the STPF 2012-15, TDAP is planning to provide subsidies for  the  opening  of  retail  outlets/warehouses  in  selected  regions,  including  Australia,  Asia  and Africa.
