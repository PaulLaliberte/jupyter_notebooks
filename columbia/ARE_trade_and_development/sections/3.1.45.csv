Pakistan  does  not  have  a  legal  and  institutional  mechanism  to  redress  consumer-related grievances  and  to  protect  consumers'  rights.  Consumer  protection  is  primarily  a  provincial responsibility and several provinces appear to have legislation or regulations related to consumer protection,  but  little  information  is  available  as  to  actual  implementation.  The  Competition Commission, has in the past couple of years, taken on a number of cases, which deal with false and misleading advertising by producers of paint and soft-drink producers, as well as fraudulent use of trademarks and unaccredited offers of university degrees.""]"
