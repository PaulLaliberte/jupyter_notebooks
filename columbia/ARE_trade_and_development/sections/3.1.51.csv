These amendments  were  intended  to  further  harmonize  the  PPL  with  the  EU  directives  in  this  area, transposing  some  of  their  provisions.  Law  No.  182/2014  excludes  from  its  scope  employment contracts  and  several  legal  services.  The  authorities  state  that  the  law  also  makes  various arrangements and clarifications in relation to the problems identified during the implementation of the  law  in  practice.  For  example,  the  law  provides  more  detailed  rules  regarding  the  framework agreement  that  can  be  signed  by  a  Contracting  Authority  with  one  or  more  economic  operators only  after  the  conclusion  of  one  form  of  the  procurement  procedures  provided  by  law.  Law No. 9643  seeks  to  harmonize  Albanian  legislation  and  align  procedures  for  the  award  of  public works,  services,  and  supply  contracts  with  EU  Directives,  particularly  Directive  2004/18/EC.

Public procurement is decentralized, with each government agency responsible for its own procurement and for implementing and administering the relevant procurement-related provisions. Contracting authorities (CAs) are subject to monitoring by the Public Procurement Agency (PPA) and  the  Supreme  Auditing  Office.  The  PPA,  under  the  Prime  Minister,  is  responsible  for  drafting legislation  and  regulations,  advising  CAs  in  relation  to  procurement  procedures,  and  supervising and monitoring procurement activities, but is not a central procuring entity. The PPA also produces a Public Procurement Bulletin (PPB) and provides procuring entities with advice and other support to  ensure  proper  and  uniform  application  of  the  PPL.  CAs  must  keep  records  and  documents regarding their awarding procedures, and must submit a report on their procurement activities to the  PPA  every  four  months.  The  Public  Procurement  Commission,  established  under  Law No. 10170/2009,  is  the  review  body  that  deals  with  administrative  complaints  about  public procurement procedures and issues administrative decisions in this regard.

The  PPL  sets  out  in  detail  the  rules  applying  to  the  procurement  of  goods,  works  and services by CAs. The stated objectives of the law are, inter alia, to promote efficiency and efficacy in  the  public  procurement  procedure,  and  to  ensure  better  use  of  public  funds  and  reduce procedural  costs.  The  PPL  also  aims  to  promote  competition  among  economic  operators, guaranteeing  equal  and  non-discriminatory  treatment  for  all  economic  operators,  and  enhancing transparency  in  public  procurement  procedures.  The  PPL  applies  to  all  types  of  procurement contracts, including procurement in the field of national defence with regard to civil procurements. The  exceptions  are  procurement  procedures  classified  as  ""state  secret"";  contracts  subject  to special security measures or in case of natural disasters, war, armed operations, military training, and  participation  in  military  missions  outside  the  country;  contracts  pursuant  to  international lending  or  donation  agreements;  contracts  dealing  with  the  acquisition  or  rental  of  buildings  or land; and some specific services.89 All public entities are covered by the PPL.

The  PPL  and  its  regulations  mandate  the  establishment  of  minimum  and  maximum monetary thresholds for procurement purposes; these thresholds are reviewed every two years. In 2015, the maximum thresholds were: lek 1.2 billion for public works contracts; and lek 200 million for public contracts for goods and services. The minimum thresholds were: lek 12 million for public works  contracts;  and  lek  8  million  for  public  contracts  for  goods  and  services.

The PPL and its regulations specify the following types of procurement procedures: open; restricted; negotiated (with or without publication of contract notice); request for proposals; small value  purchase;  consultancy  services;  and  design  contest.  The  Law  specifies  that  the  open procedure  should  be  the  preferred  procedure  for  every  CA.  This  procedure  allows  any  economic operator to submit a tender; the CA prepares a contract notice and tender documents and sends a notice to the PPA to be published in the electronic procurement system (EPS) and PPB. Suppliers submit offers, and the CA's Evaluation Commission evaluates the tender, selects the winner, and sends a notice to the EPS. The CA then concludes the contract and sends the award notice and the signed contract to the EPS.91"", '3.138.  The contract notice, contract award, and contract conclusion notices must be published for public procurement contracts using the open, restricted or negotiated procedure with publication, the design contest, the consultancy service, and request for proposals.

Once these procedures are exhausted, court actions may be initiated.

Competitive  tendering  for  goods,  services  and/or works of a value of over BDS$100,000 is managed by the Tenders Committee', '3.161.  The  general  procurement  method  is  open  tendering,  subject  to  certain  thresholds. Government  procurement  of  goods,  services  and  works  valued  at  less  than  BDS$20,000 (US$10,000) may take place through direct offers or negotiations and without the formality of a written  agreement.  Procurement  of  goods,  works  or  services  in  excess  of  BDS$20,000,  but  less than BDS$200,000 (US$100,000) does not require tendering; the award of the contract is based on  the  examination  of  written  quotations  from  interested  suppliers.  Procurement  contracts  over BDS$200,000 must be subject to an open competitive tendering procedure.', '3.162.  Procurement is generally centralized, but can be decentralized in certain cases and under certain  thresholds.  In  accordance  with  the  Financial  Administration  and  Audit  (Financial)  Rules (2011) orders for the acquisition of services or supplies that do not exceed BDS$50,000 in value can be approved by the Director of the procuring department.', '3.163.  In the case of open tenders, a notice is published in one or more newspapers in Barbados, except where the Tenders Committee is satisfied that no more than seven contractors in Barbados are  capable  of  tendering,  in  which  case  contractors  are  invited  by  letter  to  submit  a  tender. Tenders  are  not  advertised  in  the  Official  Gazette  but  some,  over  a  certain  threshold,  are advertised electronically if they are financed internationally; otherwise they are advertised in the local media. In accordance with the Financial Administration and Audit (Financial) Rules (2011), in cases of extreme urgency or of a specialized nature, the Cabinet may authorize the procurement of goods or services through direct negotiations.', '3.164.  A surety is required for tendering. This requirement must, where applicable, be stated in the notice or letter inviting tenders. The surety may take the form of a deposit of a sum of money with the Treasury or of approved securities with a value of not less than 10% of the contract price.', '3.165.  Depending  on  the  nature  and  complexity  of  the  procurement  contract,  the  time-limit  for the  submission  of  bids  varies  from  21  to  42  days.  The  criteria  considered  in  awarding  tenders include  conformity  with  tender  requirements,  as  well  as  the  financial,  technical,  and  supply capacity of the tendering firm. There is no reference in the legislation to the lowest price or cost being  a  determinant  factor  in  the  award  of  a  contract.  The  contract  is  generally  awarded  to  the ""lowest  evaluated  tender"",  considering,  apart  from  the  price,  factors  such  as  the  guarantee  of supply, the completion time, and transportation costs. Barbados\' legislation does not contemplate granting  preferences  to  domestic  or  regional  suppliers.  Tendered  procurement  opportunities  are open  to  all  suppliers.  Tender  documents  are  publicly  opened;  unsuccessful  tenderers  are  also informed of the results of the tender, but reasons for rejection are not given.', '3.166.  Procurement decisions may be challenged administratively or judicially. Complaints may be handled administratively by the Director of Finance and Economic Affairs. Judicial complaints are handled through the law courts. No court complaint has been lodged since the last review in 2008.', '3.167.  The Financial Administration and Audit (Supplies) Rules 1971 regulate the procurement of supplies.  Under  the  rules,  the  Chief  Supply  Officer  issues  invitations  to  tender,  accepts  tenders, issues orders and enters into contracts. For procurement under BDS$100,000, the Chief Supplier must maintain a list of approved suppliers for each item and must restrict invitations to tender, as well  as  contracts,  to  such  approved  suppliers.  To  be  included  in  the  list  of  approved  suppliers, potential  suppliers  must  complete  an  Application  to  Become  an  Approved  Supplier;  residence  in Barbados  is  required.  Participants in  open  tenders  do  not  need  to  be  registered.  The  authorities indicate that supplies may be bought internationally if they are not available locally.', '3.168.  The  Financial  Administration  and  Audit  (Drug  Service)  Rules  1980  apply  to  the procurement,  control,  and  disposal  of  drugs.  The  Drug  Tenders  Committee  examines  tenders  if expenditure under the contract is likely to exceed BDS$5,000; the procedures are similar to those for supplies. The Barbados Audit Office is responsible for surveying the use of procurement rules.', '3.169.  In late 2014, a new Procurement Bill was discussed in Parliament, and is expected to be passed shortly. The Bill increases the tendering threshold from BDS$200,000 to BDS$500,000 and', '\x0cWT/TPR/S/308 • Barbados', '- 77 -', 'decentralizes procurement. Procurement between BDS$100,000 and BDS$500,000 will take place through a public request for quotations from a list of suppliers. The Bill proposes the creation of a Government  Procurement  Department  to  deal  with  procurement  above  the  BDS$500,000 threshold.  For  the  decentralization  to  be  effective,  it  is  proposed  to  create  a  Procurement  Unit within each Ministry. Each Unit will be headed by a Purchasing Officer who will report monthly to the Chief Procurement Officer. The Bill also identifies the different methods of procurement to be used  and  deals  with  the  registration  and  pre-qualification  of  suppliers.  These  reforms  aim  at enhancing the transparency and efficiency of the procurement process.', '3.170.

The  Government  of  Barbados  has  implemented  the  Trade  Receivables  Liquidity  Facility (TRLF), a programme to facilitate the participation of small businesses in the procurement process. The  Facility  allows  small  businesses to  a Ministry/Department of the Central Government to receive timely payment at a discounted rate. All outstanding invoices are honoured within seven days.90 To sign up for the Facility, an individual or small business must register with the Small Business Development Unit (SBDU) at the Ministry of  Industry,  International  Business,  Commerce  and  Small  Business  Development.  The  TRLF  is available  to  small  businesses  as  defined  under  the  Small  Business  Development  Act  Cap.  318C Section 3 (b), and must satisfy any two of the three following criteria: 1) a paid-up capital of not more than BDS$1 million; 2) annual sales of no more than BDS$2 million; and 3) no more than 25 employees.  Under  the  TRLF,  a  business  or  individual  can  factor  invoices  for  a  maximum  of US$200,000 per quarter. The financial institution (commercial banks; consolidated finance; Signia Finance Corporation; Caribbean Financial Services; Enterprise Growth Fund; Barbados Agency For Micro-enterprise  Development;  and  credit  unions)  disburses  funds  to  the  small  business  or individual is discounted at the prevailing interest rate plus a 1.5% annual guarantee premium.91 Guarantee coverage is provided to eligible financial institutions for facilities factored through the Credit Guarantee Scheme for Businesses at the Central Bank of Barbados. Financial intermediaries are responsible for setting the discount rates on receivables which they have factored. Since the repayment  of  the  amounts  factored  are  guaranteed  by  the  Central  Bank  of  Barbados,  financial intermediaries are encouraged to use the risk rating of the guarantor as the basis for determining the discount rates.']"

Procurement  at  the  various  levels  of  government  can  be  centralized  or  decentralized, although  the  vast  majority  of  procurement  is  centralized.  Purchases  of  items  listed  in  the Centralized Procurement Catalogue must be carried out by centralized procurement agencies. The Procurement  Law  mandates  that  centralized  procurement  agencies  procure  quality  goods  and services, at a lower-than-average-for-the-market price.189 Decentralized procurement of items not listed  in  the  Catalogue,  but  with  a  value  above  a  certain  threshold,  which  is  specified  by governments at various levels, may be carried out by the procuring agency itself, or by entrusting it  to  agent  procurement  bodies.  In  this  case,  the  procurement  standards  are  stipulated  by  the people's governments at above provincial levels. Centralized procurement accounted for 84.8% of government procurement in 2014 (RMB 1.47 trillion), down from 86% in 2013 (RMB 1.4 trillion)."", '3.187.  The Government Procurement Law includes a ""buy-domestic"" (Article 10) provision, which was not modified by the 2014 amendment. As a result, the Government must procure domestic goods,  construction  projects  and  services,  with  certain  exceptions:  i)  when  the  goods, construction, or services required are unavailable in China or, if available, cannot be procured on reasonable commercial terms; ii) when the goods, construction, and services are procured for use abroad; or iii) when otherwise provided for by other laws and administrative regulations. There are no  criteria  specified  as  to  what  constitutes  domestic  goods  or  provisions  on  local  content.  To observations  made  by  Members  during  its last  review, China  stated  that  in practice  the  Chinese government  applies  non-discriminatory  and  equal  treatment  in  government  procurement  to products manufactured by domestic-funded and foreign-funded enterprises within the territory of China,  and  that  it  is  common  for  the  government  to  purchase  foreign  products,  but  that  no statistics  in  this  respect  were  available.  In  addition,  article  8  of  MOF  Order  No.  18  of 11 August 2004 states that the suppliers participating in bids to supply goods or services must be domestic suppliers who supply domestic goods or services. Domestic-sourcing legal requirements would  have  to  be  modified  for  procurement  above  GPA  thresholds  for  China  to  join  the GPA Agreement.', '3.188.  Despite the references in the Law to ""buy-domestic"", the Implementing Regulations of the Government Procurement Law do not make a distinction between foreign and domestic suppliers. Additionally, foreign suppliers may participate in tenders and invitations to bid concerning goods and  services  if  other  laws  and  administrative  regulations  so  prescribe.  Imports  used  for procurement  purposes  continue  to  require  approval  from  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  or  its corresponding  departments  at  the  local  level.

Public tendering is the main procurement method; it is required for procurement of items exceeding  the  prescribed  procurement  thresholds.  The thresholds  for  central  government procurement for 2014-2015 were RMB 1.2 million for goods and services, and RMB 2 million for construction projects. The thresholds for items that come under local budgets are prescribed and published  by  the  respective  governments  of  provinces,  autonomous  regions  or  municipalities directly  under  the  Central  Government  or  the  department  authorized  by  them.

In  fact,  a  major  portion  of  procurement  budgets  is  spent  on procuring  goods  and  services  from  overseas.  In  July  2010,  the  Government  endorsed  a  broad outsourcing  policy  with  the  main  objectives  of  reducing  the  government's  operational  expenses and improving efficiency in service delivery.

The  three  types  of  procedure  are:  public  invitation  to  tender;  invitation  to  at  least three bidders; and direct award of a contract. According to the national government procurement scheme  and  based  on  the  LAASSP,  the  value  of  each  contract  may  not  exceed  the  maximum amount  established  in  the  Federal  Expenditure  Budget  published  each  year.126  There  are  no thresholds determining the use of a particular type of government procurement procedure.', '3.178.  As  a  general  rule,  government  procurement  contracts  are  awarded  by  means  of  a  public invitation to tender so that bids can be freely submitted in closed envelopes, which are opened in public.  The  other  two  procedures  are  used  in  special  cases  and  their  use  must  be  justified  in writing.  They  are  used,  for  example,  when:  (a)  there  are  no  alternative or  replacement  goods or services  or  there  is  only  one  possible  supplier  in  the  market,  or  a  person  has  exclusive  use  of  a patent,  copyright  or  other  exclusive  rights,  or  in  the  case  of  works  of  art;  (b)  there  is  a  risk  for public order, the economy, health, security or the environment in Mexico as a result of an event of force majeure; (c) there are justified reasons for purchasing or leasing goods of a particular brand; and  (d)  the  goods  to  be  purchased  are  perishable  goods,  or  staple  or  semi-processed  grains  or foods.  Contracts  awarded  using  these  two  procedures,  and  which  can  be  justified  in  view  of  the amount  of  the  transaction,  may  not  account  for  more  than  30%  of  the  budget  for  procurement,', '126 The Federal Expenditure Budget for fiscal year 2016 was published in the Official Journal of', '27 November 2015.', '\x0cWT/TPR/S/352 • Mexico', '- 90 -', 'leases  or  services  of  the  department  or  entity  (Article  42  of  the  LAASSP).  In  addition  to  these procedures, there are also special government procurement procedures in each state.127', '3.179.  There are three forms of public bidding: public bidding by Mexican nationals; public bidding by  international  bidders  under  an  agreement  and  open  public  bidding  for  international  bidders (Article 28 of the LAASSP). Each department decides which form of bidding is to be used in each case.  Only  Mexican  nationals  may  take  part  in  national  bidding  procedures  and  the  goods  to  be purchased must be produced in Mexico with a minimum of 65% local content. Mexico gives priority to domestic suppliers in order to foster economic development.128 In international bidding covered by  an  agreement,  only  Mexican  or  foreign  bidders  from  countries  with  which  Mexico  has  a  trade agreement containing a section on government procurement may participate, and the goods to be purchased  must  comply  with  the  rules  of  origin  criteria  in  the  agreement.  Any  bidder  may  take part in open international bidding and the goods or services may be of any origin. This procedure is followed when a national invitation to tender has been issued but has been unsuccessful or when this is specified in contracts financed by external loans granted to the Federal Government (or with their guarantee).', '3.180.  Depending  on  the  procedure  followed,  public  bidding  may  be  in  person,  electronic  or mixed, and this is decided by each department and specified in the invitation. If the procedure is public bidding in person, bids must be submitted in writing at the time the bids are to be opened, unless  the  invitation  specifies  that  they  can  be  submitted  by  post.  The  other  procedures (information sessions, sessions at which bids are presented and opened and the final decision) all take  place  in  the  presence  of  the  bidders.  In  electronic  public  bidding,  all  the  procedures  are conducted  through  CompraNet,  and  in  mixed  bidding,  the  bidders  may  choose  to  take  part  in person or electronically (Article 26 bis of the LAASSP).', '3.181.  Mexico  still  gives  preferences  to  Mexican  bidders  in  open  international  bidding.  These preferences  only  apply  to  those  countries  with  which  Mexico  has  no  trade  agreement  on government  procurement.  During  the  review  period,  the  margin  of  preference  applied  in  open international  bidding  did  not  change  and  remains  at  15%  of  the  lowest  price  in  the  domestic market for goods of Mexican origin in comparison with imported goods (Articles 14 and 28 of the LAASSP).129  Moreover,  since  2014,  where  applicable,  points  are  also  awarded to Mexican companies  applying  gender  equality  policies  and  practices,  policies  for  the  disabled  and also companies which employ disabled workers (at least 5% of the total workforce). Points are also given  to  micro,  small  and  medium-sized  companies  producing  goods  incorporating  technological innovation, on the basis of a report prepared by the Mexican Industrial Property Institute (IMPI).130 Also,  in  January 2016,  the  LOPSRM  was  amended  inter  alia  to  require  the  public  invitation  to tender  to  show  ""the  minimum  percentage  of  local  labour  which  bidders  must  incorporate  in  the works or services to be supplied"".131', '3.182.  The  Government  Procurement  Policy  Unit  (UPCP),  part  of  the  SFP,  is  responsible  for  the CompraNet electronic public information system on procurement, leases and services. This system allows bidding procedures to be followed from publication of the invitation up to the final decision. Registration and use of the system is free of charge. In order to be registered and able to use the system,  businesses  must  have,  among  other  things,  an  advanced  electronic  signature  (FIEL), issued  by  the  Tax  Administration  Service  (SAT).  Foreign  bidders  use  the  electronic  means  of identification determined by the SFP, in which case, the electronic means of identification needed to  be  able  to  use  CompraNet  is  generated  by  the  system  itself,  following  receipt  of  the  legally certified documents and information required.', '3.183.

Each  contracting  entity  must  have  a  competent  authority  with  overall  responsibility  for procurement  contracts  (for  example,  within  central  government  ministries  this  is  usually  at permanent  secretary  level  or  above).  The  competent  authority  is,  inter  alia,  charged  with determining  the  conditions  and  budget  of  the  contract;  approving  tender  documentation;  and awarding contracts. Each competent authority is assisted in its work by a procurement department which  has  responsibility  for,  inter  alia,  collecting  procurement  needs  from  departments  to  be included in the entity's annual procurement plan; developing procurement plans; preparing bidding documents;  assisting  tender  committees;  and  liaising  with  the  Functional  Unit  of  Supervision  of Acquisition  (see  below)  on  various  matters.  A  tender  committee  is  established  by  the  competent authority  for  each  tender  issued;  it  comprises  a  minimum  of  three  officers,  including  a representative  from  the  procurement  department  and  an  officer  with  an  understanding  of  the object  to  be  procured.  The  Tender  Committee  prepares  and  submits  an  evaluation  report  to  the competent authority containing factual and legal reasons for recommending an award."", ""3.108.  Implementation  of  the  Procurement  Regulations  by  Contracting  Entities  continues  to  be overseen  by  the  Functional  Unit  of  Supervision  of  Acquisition  (Unidade  Funcional  de  Supervisão das  Aquisições  (UFSA)),  which  falls  under  the  Ministry  of  Finance.  UFSA's  responsibilities  are  set out in the 2016 Regulations (previously they were dispersed among other Diplomas) and its main role is to propose norms, and undertake supervision and training. The 2016 Regulations gave the UFSA new prerogatives to intervene actively in procurement procedures at any point and suspend tenders  if  there  are  irregularities.  Contracting  entities  are  required  to  inform  the  UFSA  when tenders are launched."", '3.109.

The  principle  behind  a  Mumarasa  is  that  of  a  negotiated  contract,  which  is  allowed  in  special circumstances.

The  use  of  different  procurement  methods  has  slightly  changed  over  the  period  under review with electronic bidding remaining the more common method.

Other agencies responsible for the administration of  government  procurement  include:  the  Bureau  of  the  Budget  (responsible  for  the  budget planning,  allocation,  and  evaluation);  the  Department  of  Special  Investigation  (inspection  of  the procurement process); the Thai Industrial Standards Institute (registration of products subject to industrial standards requirements in order to be eligible for preference margins); the Office of the Auditor  General  (procurement  audit);  the  Office  of  the  National  Anti-Corruption  Commission (inspection  of  the  procurement  process);  the  Administrative  Court  (the jurisdiction  of administrative  cases  involving  such  matters  as  a  dispute  in  relation  to  unilateral  administrative acts);  and  the  Office  of  Ombudsman  (an  alternative  for  complaint  and  bid  protest).  The Department  of  Local  Administration  in  the  Ministry  of  the  Interior  is  responsible  for  overseeing procurement  by  local  government  organizations  and  the  State  Enterprises  Policy  Office  in  the Ministry of Finance is responsible for overseeing procurement by state-owned enterprises."", ""3.79.

Criticism  over  irregularities  in  Thailand\'s  government  procurement  practices,  already discussed at previous reviews, remains valid.71 It is claimed that state enterprises and ministries typically  apply  additional  procurement  policies  and  practices  that  are  inconsistent  with  the non-discriminatory requirements of the core regulations in this area. The authorities indicated that central government entities must abide by the Regulations of the Office of the Prime Minister on Procurement B.E. 2535 (1992) and any additional practices are inconsistent with the regulation. If corruption is suspected, a procuring government agency or state enterprise may accept or reject any  or  all  bids  at  any  time  and,  in  ""special  circumstances"",  may  also  modify  the  technical requirements during the bidding process; this allegedly allows considerable leeway for government agencies and state-owned enterprises to manage procurements, while denying bidders recourse to challenge  procedures.72  The  modification  of  procurement  requirements,  sometimes  to  favour well-connected  companies  over  others,  has  led  to  the  formation  of  cartels,  as  well  as  collusion between  potential bidders. Arbitration clauses included in concessions and government  contracts require cabinet approval and are considered on a case-by-case basis.', ""3.81.  Although  Thai  officials  are  required  to  abide  by  codes  of  conduct,  both  specifically concerning  public  tendering  and  more  generally,  corruption  (section  1.4.4)  and  related  costs remain a concern.73 According to a 2011 Oxford Business Group report, state-funded infrastructure and procurement projects were plagued by massive kickbacks from suppliers and contractors. The report states that the average bribe had risen from 3% to 10-30% of a project's cost.74 Inspection of  fulfilment  of  procurement  contracts,  by  the  Materials  Inspection  and  Acceptance  Committee, and auditing of accounts by the Office of the Auditor General are intended to reduce the probability of  corruption.  Complaints  may  be  taken  to  the  National  Anti-Corruption  Commission,  the  Public Procurement Management Committee or the Auditor General. Several offences are punishable by a fine  and  imprisonment  of  five  years  to  life.  Similar  sanctions  apply  against  corrupt  bidders.

Risks to integrity in Thailand\'s non-regulated public procurement process are ""rife"" because of the large amounts of money at stake and the interface between the government and private sector, which is characterised by a high volume of transactions. Recommendations involve implementing a 20-point action plan that includes, modernizing the public procurement system based on a revised set of priorities, which would include economic, integrity, environmental, and social goals. Other activities involve adopting a coherent, sound and modern public procurement law with a full set of secondary legislation, including guidance and model documentation.

Public procurement rules apply to commercial contracts concluded by organs of state, as defined in the Constitution, for the acquisition of goods and services, and the disposal and letting of state assets. Competitive bidding is largely the most used procuring method. Procurement may take place by other means, such as price quotations or a limited bidding process, provided that a record is kept of the reasons for deviating from an invitation for competitive bids and such reasons are approved by the relevant authority. Tenders are published in the Government Tender Bulletin, on ministry websites, and sometimes in local newspapers.', '3.105.  The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa 1996 requires that when an organ of state contracts  for  goods  and  services,  it  must  follow  the  principles  of  fairness,  equitability, transparency,  competitiveness  and  cost-effectiveness.  Procurement  in  South  Africa  is  mainly regulated by the State Tender Act (Act No. 86 of 1968), and the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA). The PFMA is implemented through the regulations published under it, namely the National Treasury  Regulations  (Treasury  Regulations),  which  introduce  norms  and  standards  for transparency  and  expenditure  control  measures,  including  best  practices  to  regulate  financial management in the national and provincial spheres of government. Under the National Treasury Regulations, government agencies must establish three kinds of committee: bid specification, bid evaluation,  and  bid  adjudication  committees.  The  bid  specification  committee  is  in  charge  of elaborating:  the  terms  of  reference,  evaluation  criteria,  and  special  conditions  of  procurement contracts.  The  bid  evaluation  committee  evaluates  bids  and  makes  recommendations  to  the  bid adjudication committee, which usually follows them; otherwise it must submit a report within ten working  days  to  the  National  Treasury  and  the  Auditor-General.  The  Municipal  Finance Management Act (MFMA) extends the same principles to municipalities.', '3.106.  The  Constitution  provides  for  preferences  to  previously  disadvantaged  persons;  as  a consequence, the Preferential Procurement Policy Framework Act 5 of 2000 (PPPFA) and its 2011 revised  regulations  prescribe  requirements  regarding  Black  Economic  Empowerment  (BEE) considerations  for  government  procurement.  All  procurement  contracts  must  comply  with  the PPPFA regardless of value.', ""3.107.  In  evaluating  a  tender,  out  of  100  points,  government  agencies  must  allocate  90  to  the reference price submitted by the tenderer. This is in line with what procurement seeks to achieve, namely  getting  best  value  for  money.  The  10  remaining  points  are  allocated  in  respect  of previously  disadvantaged  persons  in  accordance  with  the  Black  Economic  Empowerment  (BEE) programme depending on ownership, management, and employment goals. Where the contract is below a prescribed threshold value (currently 1 million rand), the preference system operates on the basis of 80/20 split. The award of preference points is tied to a supplier's certified broad-based black economic empowerment (BBBEE) status in accordance with the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Act. The higher the BBBEE rating of a supplier, the higher the number of preference points  awarded.  The  regulations  to  the  PPPFA  give  guidance  on  how  to  calculate  the  points  for price and categories of preference. The regulations then require the tender to be awarded to the bidder that scores the highest number of points.
