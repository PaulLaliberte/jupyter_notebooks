Any regulatory reform of the export regime should also address the privileges available to ZEFs (described in Section 2.3.2), with a view to extending them to the entire economy so as to increase the overall offer. The scale on which these benefits are being fraudulently claimed - by several hundred companies in March 2015 - would seem to support this.34', ""3.73.  Indeed, there were over 500 approved ZEFs in 2015, though less than 150 of them were operating, with under 53,000 employees. The numbers have fallen sharply since 2006, when there were  202  free-zone  enterprises  in  operation,  with  almost  116,000  employees  in  total.  Exports under this regime in 2014 amounted to MGA 1,600 billion (about US$500 million) or one-seventh of Madagascar's total exports, which consist mainly of textiles and clothing, followed by shrimps and  crustaceans,  and  agro-industrial  products.  This  notwithstanding,  several  new  ZEFs  were established in 2015 in the textiles and other subsectors producing mattresses, soaps and building products."", '34 According to a study by International Labour Office (BIT), these investors do not really intend to', 'launch any entrepreneurial activity; the sole purpose of the application for authorization is to be able to import goods free of duty (ILO, 2011).', '\x0cWT/TPR/S/318 • Madagascar', '- 58 -', '3.74.  Madagascar  had  notified  this  ZEF  regime  to  the  WTO  in  2001  under  the  Agreement  on Trade-Related  Investment  Measures  (TRIMS)35,  as  it  is  –  in  principle  –  a  special  scheme  under which attractive tax, customs, financial and labour benefits are accorded to enterprises that export 95%  of  their  output.  One  of  the  aims  of  the  legislation  on  ZEFs  was  to  promote  and  develop private investment in production in Madagascar. Many observers are of the view that without this regime, which accounts for the bulk of processed goods and services exports, a good portion of the foreign direct investment in Madagascar would not have materialized.', '3.75.  This  suggests  the  need  to  review  and  harmonize  the  tax  system,  as  current  internal  tax rates are generally described as very high and cited as the reason why many operators remain in the informal sector.', '3.76.  Sales by ZEFs in the national customs territory (up to 5% of their real annual production) are subject to MFN import duties and taxes. ZEFs may supply one another. In practice, the goal of integrating  the  production  system  is  hardly  being  attained.  Three-quarters  of  the  inputs purchased  by  the  ZEFs  originate  abroad,  whilst  the  corresponding  figure  is  51%  for  companies under  ordinary  law  and  53%  for  the  totality  of  exporting  companies  (see  also  Section  4.6.2.2 concerning  textiles).  Generally  speaking,  the  existence  of  two  production  regimes  side-by-side accentuates the dualism within the economy in that it hampers integration between export sectors and  sectors  supplying  the  domestic  economy:  high  customs  duties  make  local  inputs  expensive and discourage exporters operating under the ZEF regime from using them, and this in turn even further increases the imported input content of exports.', '3.77.  One of the main advantages of ZEFs over companies working under the ordinary law regime is  the  absence  of  currency  exchange  restrictions  (Section  3.2.3).  The  ZEF  regime  has  been credited  for  the  export  performance  of  some  sectors,  for  example  made-up  clothing  for  the United States  market  (Section  4.6.2.2)  and  agricultural  subcontracting  for  the  production  of vegetables  for  export.  The  available  benefits  contribute  to  the  aim  of  enhancing  business competitiveness,  but  this  concerns  only  export  companies,  whilst  domestic  companies  or  those that  have  not  obtained  approval  are  to  some  extent  left  to  fend  for  themselves.  The  domestic value-added generated by the ZEF system would probably be higher if the entire economy could share in the gains that it provides.']"
