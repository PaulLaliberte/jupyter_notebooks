Malaysia has 18 free industrial zones (FIZs)92, only for manufacturing activities, and 17 free commercial  zones  (FCZs)93;  these  were  established  to  facilitate  operations  of  export-oriented companies. No federal or main coordinating body oversees the development of the FIZs. To qualify for  location  in  a  FIZ,  a  company  must  export  at  least  80%  of  its  output;  its  raw materials/components are mainly imported, even though the Government encourages the use of local raw materials/components. If a FIZ company has obtained approval from MITI to reduce its export performance requirement to 60%, it may also apply to the Customs to be allowed to export 60% instead of 80% of its output. Effective 1 January 2011, FIZ companies benefit from import duty exemptions if they achieve 40% of local content value; when the local content value does not reach  40%,  consideration  may  be  given  if  the  FIZ/LMW  companies  can  prove  that  the non-originating  raw  material  to  the  end  products  produced  had  undergone  substantive transformation process through a set mechanism.94 Any goods, from overseas or within Malaysia, and services of any description, except those prohibited by law, may be brought into, produced or provided in the zones without payment of any tariffs, excises, sales or service taxes. Domestic and foreign enterprises located in the zones are eligible for tax exemptions on income from promoted activities  (section  3.4.1.3).95  Malaysia  also  allows  exporters  to  a  licensed  manufacturing warehouse (LMW), which offers the same benefits as operating within a FIZ while offering greater freedom of location. As of September 2013 2,110 companies were operating in LMWs, 20 in FIZs, and 15 in FCZs. No data indicating the activities of firms established in FIZs/FCZs/LMWs, the jobs created within the zones, the forgone tax revenue due to the FIZs/FCZs/LMWs incentives, or the value  of  exports  of  and  imports  from  these  zones  as  a  percentage  of  total  exports  and  imports were available from the authorities.']"
