According to a World Bank study, in 2015, Albania was ranked second among the top ten reformers, and 97th overall out of 189 economies analysed.62  3.3.2  Incentives', '3.100.  State assistance to private economic activity is governed by Law No. 9374 of 21 April 2005 ""On  State  Aid"",  as  amended  by  Law  No.  10183  of  29 October  2009,  unchanged  since  Albania\'s previous review.63 The law applies to all manufacturing and services activities; it does not apply to state aid granted to agriculture and fisheries. It establishes the conditions under which state aid may be granted, namely, if it: promotes the economic development of areas with low standards of living  or  where  there  is  serious  unemployment;  promotes  a  project  of  national  importance  or remedies  a  serious  disturbance  in  the  economy;  facilitates  the  development  of  certain  economic activities  or  of  certain  economic  areas,  provided  the  aid  granted  does  not  adversely  affect  the obligations  under  any  international  agreements  ratified  by  Albania;  or  promotes  cultural development and heritage conservation, where it does not seriously affect trading conditions and competition. The authorities state that locals and foreigners are treated alike with respect to the fiscal incentives provided.', '3.101.  The  law  forbids  aid  directly  linked  to  export  quantities  or  current  expenditure  linked  to export activities, as well as aid contingent upon the use of domestic over imported goods. Aid to sensitive  sectors  is  not  compatible  with  this  law,  unless  provided  by  the  State  Aid  Commission (SAC). In 2014, sectoral  state aid amounted to lek 1,115 million; the aid  was granted  to public services (water supply and sewage – in the form of a subsidy from the state budget to 55 water supply undertakings managed by local municipalities), public transport (railways – in the form of a direct  subsidy),  mining  (closure  and  conservation).  Aid  for  the  energy  sector  was  also  granted, amounting  to  lek  195  million  in  the  form  of  deferred  payment  of  VAT  for  electricity  import.  Aid classified  as  de  minimis  is  compatible  with  this  law.64  Nonetheless,  it  would  appear  that  the implementation  of  the  law  is  poor,  mainly  due  to  the  lack  of  independence  and  adequate administrative capacity of the competent bodies.65', '3.102.

The  same  percentage  applies  for  first  participation  in  fairs  and exhibitions, where the aid must not exceed 50% of the additional costs incurred in renting, setting up,  and  running  a  stand.  Newly  created  SMEs  may  also  receive  aid,  of  up  to  €200,000  for installation costs.

According to the authorities, all existing state-aid schemes are listed in the Report on the Inventory of State Aid Schemes in Albania, as approved by DCM No. 45 of 16 January 2008.', '3.105.  SMEs may benefit from the Albanian Competitiveness Fund, established by Law No. 9645 of 27 November 2006 ""On the State Budget of 2007"", and managed by AIDA.

A Development Programme for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) funded by Italy aims at improving access to finance for SMEs. The programme consists of a €25 million credit line and a guarantee fund of €2.5 million for loan guarantees that aim to counter the main obstacles to bank crediting. On 12 July 2014, a Programme of Integrated Assistance for the Development of Albanian SMEs entered into force; the programme is to replenish the financial facilities established within the  first  phase  of  the  Italian-funded  programme  by  providing  an  additional  €15  million.68  The second component, the guarantee fund, started to be implemented in April 2011, after the signing of the Albanian Guarantee Fund (AGF) Participation Agreement between the Ministry of Economy and  eight  private  commercial  banks.

The  People\'s  Bank  of  China  (PBC)  continues  to  guide  financial  institutions  to  increase financial  support  to  important  areas  of  the  economy  and  disadvantaged  sectors,  and  to  extend credit to key sectors and emerging industries, such as railways, clean energy and environmental protection.  Since  2014,  a  new  category  of  ""credit  policy  supporting  central  bank  loans""  was introduced,  which  included  agriculture-supporting  loans  and  SME-supporting  loans.  Financial institutions were encouraged to use flexible credit products so as to enhance support for imports and  domestic  consumption.  In  2014-2015,  financial  institutions  were  guided  to  increase  ""green"" credit.

Nonetheless, the  policy  of  supporting  specific  industries  seems  to  remain  in  place.  For  instance,  the  energy sector  receives  support  to  develop  particular  alternative  energy  sources  (e.g.  natural  gas,  wind power, solar power, geothermal power and nuclear power).

Under the Fiscal Incentives Act, a tax holiday of up to 15 years may be granted for the manufacture of approved products by approved enterprises.

The  Act  provides  for  additional  benefits  in  the  form  of  income  tax rebates  at  the  termination  of  the  tax  holiday  period.  The  rebates  are  based  on  the  company's share of export profits in its total profits.
