Inspection  costs  are  charged  at  the  rate  of  0.75%  of  the  f.o.b.  value,  with  a  minimum charge of US$100. At a rate of 0.75%, US$100 would correspond to imports worth US$13,333. As the  minimum  amount  at  which  imports  begin  to  be  affected  is  US$2,500,  this  lump  sum corresponds to a maximum levy that is much greater than 0.75%. Thus, for any imports with a value  on  the  range  from  US$2,500  to  US$13,333,  the  charges  will  be  greater  than  0.75%  and could amount to as much as 4% in the case of imports worth US$2,500.

According to the authorities, in 2014, 70,939 inspections were carried out on goods with a total value of about US$4 billion. In the same year, total preshipment inspection costs amounted to  about  US$51 million.  In  fact,  its  objectives  notwithstanding,  the  mandatory  nature  of  this inspection  is  increasing  the  cost  of  imports  by  the  amount  of  the  charges  (especially  the  lump sum) levied on the importers and is duplicating the work of the customs, but not that of the OCC for which BIVAC works as a subcontractor.', '3.35.
