During the review period, action was taken to regulate and facilitate trade by simplifying duty concessions for industry (section 3.2.2.6); reforming international trade remedies and setting up a new Anti-Dumping Commission (section 3.2.6.1);  participating in regional trade agreements and multilateral  fora  (section  2.4.2.1);  enhancing  international  cooperation  and  data-sharing;  and seconding  United  States  Customs  and  Border  Protection  Services  to  enhance  international targeting and risk assessment of shipments of common interest.4 The ratification of the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement is to be concluded by mid-2015 (section 2.1).

The 2012 TRS showed that more than 66% of sea cargo and more than 80% of air cargo is now fully risk-assessed and unimpeded by the time it is physically available for delivery. Impediments range  from  incomplete  reporting  to  goods  that  require  inspection  or  biosecurity  treatment (section 3.2.7.2.2).

Exports  whose  f.o.b.  value  is  less than US$5,000 are processed by means of a streamlined export declaration (DSE)87, which can be done  electronically  through  SUNAT's  website  or  directly  in  its  offices.  The  documents  required to substantiate  export  are  the  same  in  both  cases:  a  copy  or  photocopy  of  the  transport document; a copy of proof of payment (invoice or sales slip); and special authorizations or other certificates  depending  on  the  nature  of  the  goods  (for  example,  certificates  of  origin  or  sanitary certificates).

The  amber  channel  applies  to  most  declarations and they  are  automatically  regularized  solely  through  acceptance  of  the  digitalized  information indicating  that  the  goods  have  been  shipped.  For  goods  assigned  to  the  red  channel, the documents are examined and there is also a physical inspection. Currently, only 4% of goods go through the red channel.88', '3.79.  All  goods  for  export,  with  a  few  exceptions,  must  be  placed  under  the  authority  of  the Customs  and  therefore  stored  in  a  temporary  warehouse.  Perishable  goods  requiring  special storage and live animals are exempt from this requirement, together with dangerous goods, heavy and/or large machines and products to be exported in bulk in any state. In these cases, after the DAM has been processed, the customs broker has to forward the request for direct loading from the warehouse designated by the exporter.89']"

Namibia uses a single administrative document (SAD 500) for  customs declaration and the ASYCUDA++  customs  management  system.  Customs  maintains  a  consolidated  monthly  import entry procedure to enable regular importers of SACU products to enter data on a monthly customs declaration.  It  also  has  a  Direct  Trader  Input  (DTI)  system  linked  to  the  ASYCUDA++  system. Namibia is in the process of migrating to ASYCUDA World. The DTI is used by cargo carriers and freight forwarders and enables entry documentation to be processed electronically. A preliminary time release study on the average time to lodge a declaration, effect payment, and release goods has been done under the WCO-SACU Customs Development Programme (CDP), but further work is still required before it can be confirmed. Under a bond guarantee system which operates on goods in transit through Namibia, importers lodge a security to cover all charges, including local taxes and VAT; the bond may be redeemed once the goods have left Namibia. Security for the in bond removal of goods and warehousing is currently being reviewed.']"
