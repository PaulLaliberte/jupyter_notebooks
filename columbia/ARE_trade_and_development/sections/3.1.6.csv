The  Kyrgyz  Republic  began  privatization  of  public  enterprises  after  independence  in  the early 1990s. The process is ongoing. The first stage included small privatization, i.e. privatization of entities in services, trade, and housing and construction. The next stage comprised share sales of large and medium-sized state enterprises in manufacturing, transport, and construction. During the third stage, priority was given to transforming large strategic entities of monopolized economic sectors, privatization of insolvent or bankrupt enterprises, and completion of coupon privatization. Entities  in  other  areas  such  as  utilities  and  housing,  health  resorts  and  recreational,  sports, tourism, and similar areas, were also subject to privatization.', '3.149.  While over 70% of public sector entities have been transferred into private ownership, the State remains the owner of many strategically important enterprises in fuel and energy activities, mining, natural monopolies, and telecommunications. The State, represented by the Fund for State Property  Management,  is  a  shareholder  in  59  joint-stock  companies,  of  which  22  are  strategic companies. The state owns the controlling interest of stock in 38 companies, and there are 158 state enterprises under government ministries and agencies.

Other key developments have included improving the transparency and  openness  of  the  process  of  privatization.  Previously,  it  was  the  norm  to  privatize  state property through auctions or tenders without setting the price. This resulted in corruption and sale of the state property at below-value prices. This practice was abolished in 2010.
