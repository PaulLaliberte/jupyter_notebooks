According  to  the  Commission,  around  25%  of  waste  shipments  sent  from  the  EU  to developing  countries in  Africa  and  Asia may  be  thought  to  contravene  international  regulations.97 The amendment to the waste shipment regulation (WSR) introduced through Regulation (EU) No. 660/2014 required member States to establish inspection plans for waste shipments by 1 January 2017.  These  inspections  plans  shall  include  a  minimum  set  of  elements  and  shall  be  based  on  a risk assessment.', '3.99.  According  to  data  from  2012,  around  400,000  tonnes  of  Waste  Electrical  and  Electronic Equipment  (WEEE)  could  be  illegally  exported  out  of  the  EU  annually.98  When  waste  arrives illegally at a destination country, that waste is often dumped or mismanaged in a way that causes serious negative impacts on human health and the environment.', '3.100.  The significantly lower costs for waste treatment and disposal in developing countries is an important  economic  driver  for  illegal  waste  shipments.  These  lower  costs  are  mainly  a  result  of less  stringent  environmental  and  health  regulation  than  in  the  EU,  and  indeed  complete  side-stepping  of  controls  in  some  cases.  If  recycling  standards  and  capacity  are  not  adequate  in  the country  of  destination,  potential  environmental  and  health  hazards  are  simply  being  exported  to other parts of the world.', '3.101.  As  noted  in  the  previous  Review,  the  EU  WSR99  bans  all  exports  of  hazardous  waste  to non-OECD  countries  and  all  exports  of  waste  for  disposal  outside  the  EU/EFTA.  Illegal  waste shipments  must  be  taken  back  when  detected.  The  WSR  allows  non-hazardous  waste  to  be exported for recovery operations outside the OECD but requires national authorities to verify that it  will  be  managed  in  an  environmentally  sound  manner  in  facilities  that  are  operated  in accordance  with  standards  that  are  broadly  equivalent  to  standards  established  in  the  EU.  The WSR requires member States to lay down rules on the penalties applicable for the infringement of its provisions. The penalties provided for must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. The WSR', 'man-made catastrophes. The Austrian scheme allows the State to provide reinsurance to insurance companies active in Austria that covers these risks incurred by exporters. As such, coverage is currently not sufficiently provided by the market; there is no risk that the State intervention will crowd out existing suppliers. The Commission therefore concluded that the scheme was in line with its 2012 Communication. The scheme is authorized until 31 December 2020.

OJ L 190, 12 July 2006, pp. 1–98.', '\x0cWT/TPR/S/357 • European Union', '- 69 -', 'also requires member States to cooperate, bilaterally and multilaterally, with one another in order to facilitate the prevention and detection of illegal shipments.', '3.102.  Whether a shipment is authorized under the WSR, and under what conditions, depends on the  cross-border  movement,  the  processing  method,  the  type  of  waste  and  the  country  of destination.  EU  legislation  imposes  stricter  requirements  on  some  types  of  waste  than  others, depending  on  the  environmental  and  health  risk.  In  the  case  of  e-waste  for  example,  the  EU introduced the so-called WEEE Directive in order to prevent and reduce the adverse impacts from the generation and management of WEEE. This Directive came into force in 2003 and was recast in 2012.', '3.103.  The EU has introduced extensive amendments to both the WSR100 (in 2014) and the WEEE Directive101  (in  2012)  concerning  inspections  and  enforcement.  Amendments  to  the  WSR introduced in June 2014 will not fully come into force until 2017.102 These amendments have the potential to improve inspection  and  enforcement  on  the  ground,  to  the  extent  that  the  individual member  States  are  willing  and  able  to  provide  the  necessary  budgetary  and  staff  resources  to implement the new provisions effectively. As the Commission has pointed out, while some member States have thorough, well-functioning inspection systems targeting either illegal waste shipments in  ports  or  on  the  sites  of  waste  producers  and  collectors,  others  lag  behind.  This  leads  to  ""port hopping"" – exporters of illegal waste choosing to export their waste from member States with the most lenient controls.', ""3.104.  In  July  2016,  the  Commission  adopted  an  implementing  regulation103  setting  out  a preliminary  correlation  table  between  customs  and  waste  codes.  The  table,  which  has  been integrated  in  the  customs'  TARIC  database,  is  expected  to  serve  as  a  tool  to  assist  in  curbing illegal exports of waste out of the EU. This regulation is in line with the further measures foreseen by  the  Commission  in  its  Circular  Economy  Action  Plan  adopted  on  2  December  2015  to  help ensure  that  the  WSR  is  effectively  implemented  and  that  illegal  shipments  causing  raw  material leakage are addressed more effectively.""]"
