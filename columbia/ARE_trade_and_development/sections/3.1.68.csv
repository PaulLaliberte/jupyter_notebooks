The thrust of Ghana's trade policy is to promote economic growth. This perhaps explains the authorities'  widespread  tolerance  of  tariff  and  other  import  duty  exemptions.  Indeed,  one particularity  of  Ghana's  import  system  is  the  intensive  use  by  private  operators  of  the  multiple import duty exemptions, concessions and other schemes available in the Customs Law, effectively allowing them not to pay customs duties, ODCs, VAT or other taxes as the case may be."", '3.50.  In  order  to  minimize  the  loss  of  revenue  that  inevitably  results  from  these  exemptions, in 2000 the Government introduced a special ""processing fee"" of 1% levied on certain (but not all) imports that are statutorily exempt from duty, zero-rated or re-exported from warehouses, thus complicating further the administration of import taxation.17', '3.51.  Part of the annual loss of revenue resulting from certain import exemptions is captured by Customs  in  its  ""import  exemption""  statistic,  compiled  as  part  of  the  budget.  In 2013,  this  loss amounted to 5.6% of Ghana\'s total tax revenue (Chart 3.1 above). The actual revenue foregone is likely  to  be  much  higher  as  the  import  exemption  as  it  is  currently  compiled  does  not  include exemptions  granted  under  export  processing  zone,  bonded  warehouse,  or  GIPC  provisions (Table 3.6).  This  highlights  an  urgent  need  to  streamline  and  simplify  the  existing  exemptions, which  are  complex  and  expensive  to  administer,  cause  a  substantial  shortfall  in  government revenue every year, and could be contrary to Ghana\'s WTO commitments.', 'Table 3.6 Schemes providing for tariff exemptions, 2013', 'Description / Legislation Imports under the Ghana Investment Promotion Centre Act / GIPC Act  Imports by hotels and tourism industry (listed items e.g. refrigerators, televisions, etc.) Imports by restaurants (listed items) Local film producers (sound recording and other listed apparatus) Imports by manufacturers approved by the Commissioner / Customs and Excise (Duties and other taxes) Act, 1996 (Act 512) Raw materials for the manufacture of agricultural and fishing equipment, and of phytosanitary products (e.g. disinfectants, etc.).

In Ghana, a large share of imports is cleared into bonded warehouses. The goods can stay there  up  to  four  years.  Of  the  goods  that  are  cleared  from  bonded  warehouses  to  the  domestic market, about 25% are exempted from import duties. For example, vehicles and other goods are frequently cleared out of bonded warehouses duty-free, under the ""Clearance on permit pending approval""  system.  In  addition,  despite  the  physical  controls  that  are  applied,  there  are  many reports  of  abuse  of  bonded  warehouse  facilities.  Products  such  as  rice,  sugar  or  consumer electronics  are  imported  into  warehouses  under  temporary  exemption;  they  are  subsequently released for re-export to neighbouring countries, but in fact sold in the domestic market without payment of duty or VAT. The application of the bonded warehousing provisions therefore deserves to be reviewed with a view to ensuring equity and increasing revenue. A large share of Ghana\'s exempt  imports  also  apparently  enters  under  letters  granting  exemptions  from  the  Ministry  of Finance,  initiated  in  other  ministries,  such  as  Agriculture,  Social  Welfare  and  Employment  and Health.', ""3.53.  The  users  of  imported  goods  brought  in  under  exemption  have  a  market  advantage  over users  of  the  same  goods  imported  under  the  statutory  tariff  rate.  In  general,  these  exemptions therefore  create  an  arbitrary  differential  in  protection  across  firms.  They  also  encourage rent-seeking and corruption, as importers and users of imported goods lobby for exemptions. The wide  use  of  exemptions  also  creates  anomalies  in  Ghana's  tariff  structure,  reducing  tariff protection  to  producers  of  exempted  goods,  and  increasing  effective  protection  to  the  users  of exempted raw material inputs."", '\x0cWT/TPR/S/298 • Ghana', '- 50 -']"
