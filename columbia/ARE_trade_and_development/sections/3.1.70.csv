Otherwise, products which incorporate parts from third countries (which account for over 7% of the transaction value) must in most cases undergo a change in tariff classification. For chemicals, plastics and some fertilisers, the criteria for substantial  transformation  is  that  a  chemical  reaction  or  purification  must  have  taken  place.  Origin  is determined in some specific cases by a regional value content as specified in an attachment to Appendix I. There are also some instances where rules of origin criteria have yet to be developed. Rules of origin are spelled out in Chapter IV of the Agreement.

Except as specified in a product-specific rule of origin of Annex IV.03 the previous definition does not apply to a non-originating material used in the production of a good included in HS Chapters 1-24, unless the non-originating material is provided for in a different subheading from the good for which origin is being determined.  A good provided in HS Chapters 50-63, that is a non-originating good because certain fibres or yarns used in the production of the component of the good that determines the tariff classification of the good do not undergo  an  applicable  change  in  tariff  classification  set  out  in  Annex  IV.03,  shall  nonetheless  be considered  an  originating  good  if  the  total  weight  of  all  such  fibres  or  yarns  in  that  material  does  not exceed 10% of the total weight of that material.

In general, the trade agreements that have entered into force for Panama since 2007 have similar  rules  of  origin.31  Specific  rules  of  origin  vary,  however,  in  each  agreement  or  bilateral protocol,  and  for  different  products,  in  order  to  take  into  account  the  special  features of the countries party to each agreement. Textiles and clothing are usually the subject of special rules of origin.', '3.48.  In the majority of agreements signed by Panama, a good is deemed to be originating if it meets  one  of  the  following  criteria:  (i)  it  has  been  wholly  obtained  or  produced  in  the  territory of one or more of the parties; (ii) it has been produced in one or more parties from non-originating materials,  with  a  change  in  tariff  classification  or  a  regional  content  value,  or  a  combination of the two;  or  (iii)  it  has  been  produced  in  one  or  more  parties  exclusively  from  originating materials. In the Agreement between Central America and the EU, the following are the general criteria  conferring  origin:  the  product  must  have  been  wholly  obtained  in  one  of  the  parties; the product  has  been  obtained  in  one  of  the  parties  incorporating  materials  not  wholly  obtained in one  of the parties  provided  that  these  materials  have  been  sufficiently  worked  or  processed in one of the parties.', '3.49.  In  almost  all  the  agreements  (except  that  with  the  EU),  the  change  in  tariff  classification criterion,  which  usually  requires  a  change  in  tariff  heading,  applies.  In  some  cases,  however, a change  in  tariff  chapter  is  required  (for  agricultural,  mineral  and  other  products)  or  a  change in tariff subheading (coffee, tea, base metals).', '3.50.  Some  products  have  to  comply  with  a  minimum  value  of  regional  content  (RCV), usually 30%  to  45%,  although in  the  bilateral  protocols  between  Panama  and  some Central American countries, the RCV is higher and may reach as much as 85%. It is either applied as a single criterion or combined with a change in tariff classification. Generally, two formulas are used  to  calculate  the  RCV:  the  build-down  method  (the  value  of  non-originating  materials  is deducted from the adjusted value of the product) or the build-up method (obtained by adding the value  of  originating  materials).  A  third  is  the  net  cost  method,  used  to  calculate  the  RCV of automobile  parts  and  components  (for  example,  in  the  agreement  between  Panama  and  the United States).', ""3.51.  All the agreements mentioned contain a de minimis rule which allows a non-originating good to be deemed as originating if the value of all the non-originating materials of which it is composed do  not  exceed  10%  of  the  value  of  the  good.  For  textiles  and  clothing,  the  weight of non-originating yarns and fibres must not exceed 10% of the material's weight."", '3.52.  The  agreements  allow  for  cumulation  of  origin  between  the  parties  and,  in  some  cases, also in  respect  of  third  countries  with  which  each  party  has  a  trade  agreement.  The  agreement between Panama and Peru, for example, not only allows bilateral cumulation but also cumulation in respect of materials from Central American countries, provided that both Panama and Peru have an  agreement  in  force  with  those  countries,  respectively,  and  that  specific  rules  of  origin  are observed.', '27 For the agreements which came into force prior to 2007, see WTO (2007). 28 WTO documents G/RO/N/92 of 9 April 2013 and G/RO/N/95 of 16 May 2013. 29 WTO document G/RO/N/93 of 9 April 2013. 30 The exceptions are set out in Annex 6(a) to the Protocol.
