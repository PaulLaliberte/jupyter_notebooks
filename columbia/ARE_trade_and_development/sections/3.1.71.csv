During  the  period  under  review,  there  were  no  changes  concerning  non-food  labelling requirements under the Consumer Product Safety Act and Electrical Appliance and Material Safety Law.  With  regard  to  the  Industrial  Safety  and  Health  Measures,  some  chemical  substances  have been newly designated as substances that are required to have a label on the container or package when  the  substances  are  transferred  or  provided.115  The  Textile  Goods  Quality  Labeling Regulations were amended to adopt a new standard on textile care instructions for home washing, etc.  in  line  with  the  relevant  ISO  standard.  These  Regulations  are  to  enter  into  force  on 1 December 2016.', '3.153.  With  regard  to  food  labelling,  as  mentioned  above,  some  food  labelling  provisions  which had  previously  been  scattered  across  three  separate  laws  have  been  gathered  into  a  single  new Food Labeling Act, promulgated on 28 June 2013. To implement the Act, a Food Labeling Standard establishing  specific  labelling  requirements  was  defined.  The  Act  and  Standard  entered  into  force on 1 April 2015.', '3.154.  The  main  changes  to  food  labelling  requirements  during  the  period  under  review  concern food  allergen  labelling,  mandatory  nutrient  declaration,  and  the  Food  with  Function  Claims  (FFC) labelling  system.  Under  the  new  food  allergen  labelling  requirement,  which  entered  into  force  on 1 April  2015,  the  name  of  the  food  allergen  must  be  indicated  in  parentheses  immediately  after the  name  of  the  food  ingredient  containing  it,  except  when  all  names  of  allergens  appear  in parentheses  collectively  at  the  end  of  the  ingredient  list.  As  regards  mandatory  nutrient declaration,  under  the  previous  standard  (the  Nutrition  Labeling  Standard),  nutrition  declaration was  voluntary  for  pre-packaged  processed  foods.  The  new  Food  Labeling  Standard  requires mandatory  declaration  of  energy  value,  the  amounts  of  protein,  fat,  carbohydrates  and  sodium (expressed  in  salt equivalent)  for  pre-packaged  processed  foods  and  food  additives  to  be  offered as such to the consumer. Certain foods may be exempted, for example, on the basis of nutritional or  dietary  insignificance  or  small  packaging  or  others.  The  declaration  of  saturated  fatty  acids, cholesterol,  available  carbohydrates  (i.e.  dietary  carbohydrates  excluding  dietary  fibre),  sugars, dietary fibre, vitamins and minerals is voluntary.', '3.155.  Genetically  modified  (GM)  foods  must  be  labelled  as  such.  Presently,  the  list  of  GM products  that  need  to  be  labelled  comprises  eight  crops  (soybeans,  corn,  rapeseed,  potatoes, cottonseed,  alfalfa,  papaya,  and  sugar  beet)  and  33 kinds  of  designated  processed  food,  mainly made  of  soybeans  or  corn;  papaya  and  processed  foods  containing  papaya  as  a  main  ingredient are recent additions. The MHLW does not permit imports of GM foods that do not meet its safety requirements.', '3.156.  As  regards  food  with  health  claims,  a  new  standard,  which  entered  into  force  on 1 April 2015,  has  established  a  third  category,  that  of  ""Foods  with  Functional  Claims""  (FFC) alongside  the  two  pre-existing  categories  (""Foods  with  Nutrient  Functions  Claims""  (FNFC)  and ""Food  for  Specified  Health  Uses""(FOSHU)).
