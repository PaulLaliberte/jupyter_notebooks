The  Plan  emphasizes  certain  priority  crops: cotton,  sugar,  hot  pepper,  herbs  and spices,  sweet  potatoes,  yams  and  onions.  The  mandate  of Plant  Protection  is  the  phytosanitary  security  and  conservation  of  Barbados’  agricultural  plant biodiversity  through  the  identification  of  plant  pests  and  diseases  and  the  provision  of environmentally  sound  control  practices.

The  Act  will  consolidate  and  replace  existing  food legislation,  other  than  the  FDA56,  and  enhance  inspection  powers.  It  applies  to  all  food commodities  that  are  traded  inter-provincially  and  internationally,  but  not  to  natural  health products.

Before  approving  the  entry  of  poultry  and  poultry  products  or  byproducts  into Honduran  territory,  the  SENASA  inspects  and  verifies  the  operation  of  veterinary  services  in  the  country of origin,  and  also  evaluates  their  diagnostic  and  epidemiological  surveillance  and  risk  analysis  systems  for detecting  Newcastle  disease.  The  SENASA  requires  that  all  imports  of  poultry  and  poultry  products  be accompanied  by  a  veterinary  certificate.  Moreover,  it  carries  out  random  controls  at  the  border  in  order  to prevent  the  entry  of  any  product  presenting  a  risk  of  introducing  Newcastle  disease  into  Honduras. The SENASA also periodically conducts clinical inspections and serological and virological testing of poultry in areas  adjacent  to  a  country  or  zone  infected  by  Newcastle  disease.  Any  outbreak  of  the  disease  must  be notified immediately. Honduras also regulates the transport of poultry sector products. Lorries used to transport such products must be  cleaned  and  disinfected  prior  to  loading  and  after  unloading,  using  the  procedures  prescribed  by  the SENASA. In addition, lorries used to carry poultry from farms to processing plants must be used exclusively for this purpose and must be cleaned and disinfected after each journey. The materials used to transport poultry must also be cleaned and disinfected daily.  Any production unit may be placed in quarantine as a precautionary or definitive measure if an outbreak of the disease is suspected or confirmed. Quarantine measures may only be suspended by the SENASA. If there is an outbreak  of  the  disease,  the  SENASA  follows  the  procedures  and  guidelines  established  by  international organizations for its control and eradication.', '50 Regulations on epidemiological surveillance, prevention and control of bovine spongiform', 'encephalopathy (BSE) (Decision No. 401-13).', '51 The country-risk categories determined by the OIE are also recognized.', '\x0cWT/TPR/S/336 • Honduras', '- 59 -', ""All owners of poultry must be registered with the competent authorities and comply with the epidemiological surveillance provisions and procedures determined in the National Poultry Farming Programme.

The  law  also regulates  veterinary-sanitary  inspections  and  control  and  activities  in  the  field  of  veterinary medicine.', '-  The  2011  Law  on  Veterinary  Medicinal  Products  lays  down  the  requirements  and procedures for approval and placing on the market, manufacture, import, ownership, trade, usage and control of veterinary medicinal products.', '3.78.  In addition, the Feed Safety Law (as amended in 2012) covers all phases of the production, processing,  and  distribution  of  feed,  and  the  use  of  feed.  The  2007  Law  on  Animal  By-products contains provisions on the categorization, collection, transportation, disposal, processing, use, and storage of animal by-products from the aspect of animal health and veterinary public health.', '3.79.  The  Food  and  Veterinary  Agency  (FVA)  is  responsible  for  food/feed  safety  controls,  for protecting consumer health, and for implementing veterinary activities. It was established in 2011 by merging the Veterinary Directorate of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy and the Food Directorate of the Ministry of Health. The FVA harmonizes national legislation with international standards by adopting recommendations from Codex Alimentarius and the OIE. The EU Commission has noted in its most recent progress report that good progress has been made concerning general food safety. In principle, the food industry has been brought into compliance with WTO and EU standards, and the HACCP (hazard analysis and critical control points) system has been obligatory since 2009.', ""3.80.   The FVA has adopted a single multiannual national control plan on state surveillance over food  movements,  a  strategy  paper  on  veterinary  and  plant  health,  and  a  multiannual  training programme. Preparations have also started on a new food safety strategy (2013-15) and a general crisis management plan.25 An internal system for control and auditing has been established within the  FVA  and  the  Agency  is  in  charge  of  providing  information  about  any  direct  or  indirect  food-related  risks  to  the  population's  health.  The  EU  Commission  also  states  that  good  progress  has been made on measures to control animal diseases such as rabies and swine fever."", '3.81.  The FVA is responsible for the control of import and export of live animals, and products and by-products of animal origin at border-crossings. Currently, ten border inspection posts (BIPs) are in  operation  on  the  borders  with  Albania,  Bulgaria,  Serbia,  and  Greece,  and  there  is  an international  BIP  at  Skopje  airport.  In  order  to  guarantee  effective  control,  in  the  period  before accession to the EU, the Government is looking to upgrade the BIPs to EU standards. The duties and  responsibilities  for  conducting  official  veterinary  controls  at  the  border  are  laid  down  in  the current  legislation,  in  particular  the  laws  on  Veterinary  Health,  Animal  By-Products,  Welfare  of Animals, Food Safety, and Animal Identification and Registration. Food and food-related products and products of animal origin cannot be imported until veterinary inspection and approval of the consignment has been completed at designated border crossings. The EU Commission points out that the system of reduced physical checks of consignments at the BIPs is not yet implemented.', '3.82.  Under the current system, the import of animals and animal by-products is permitted only through  border  posts.  During  import,  the  consignment  undergoes  a  documentary  check,  an identity  check,  and  a  physical  check  by  an  official  veterinarian,  who  should  be  notified  by  the importer at least 24 hours before the expected time of arrival of the consignment.', '3.83.  The Phytosanitary Directorate in the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy is the  competent  authority  for  plant  health,  overall  plant  protection,  and  production,  usage  and marketing of fertilizers. According to Article 69 of the Plant Health Law, the Directorate integrates international  standards  for  phytosanitary  measures  into  the  national  legislation;  the  EU Commission  has  noted  that  the  implementation  of  international  standards  (e.g.  on  surveillance, export  certification,  and  determination  of  pest  status)  has  not  been  carried  out,  although  the', '25 Ministry of Finance (2012), p. 83.', '\x0cWT/TPR/S/290 • The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia', '- 52 -', 'Directorate is preparing a number of monitoring programmes.

Phytosanitary  policy  objectives  for  2012-14  are  to  raise  the  quality  of  seed  and  planting material, strengthen the system of internal monitoring of diseases in plants, and quality control of preparations for plant protection and fertilizers. In its 2012 report, the EU Commission stated that little  progress  had  been  achieved  in  phytosanitary  policy,  partly  due  to  insufficient  coordination between  the  various  authorities  and  the  Directorate's  limited  administrative  capacity,  and concluded that preparations were still at an early stage. In response, the authorities note that in 2012 cooperation between the Phytosanitary Administration and the State Agriculture Inspectorate was improved regarding data exchange and other import/export related activities."", '3.85.  Provisions for conducting official import and export controls for plant health are laid down in the Laws on: Plant Health, Plant protection product based on EU Directive 91/414 /EC, Fertilizers, Seed and Propagation Material, and Protection of new plant varieties. The control of import/export plant  consignments  is  within  the  competence  of  the  phytosanitary  inspectors  who  determine whether  the  consignment  is  accompanied  by  the  requisite  certificate,  is  not  subject  to  harmful organisms, meets special phytosanitary requirements, etc.']"

Import  permits  for  live  animals,  animal  products,  plants,  plant  products,  and fertilizers (valid for four weeks) are issued by the competent departments of the MAIWD. Typically, the  permits  specify  the  total  quantity  and  value  of  a  particular  product  that  can  be  traded.  The import  permit  and  a  sanitary  or  phytosanitary  certificate  issued  by  the  exporting  country  are required  when  the  goods  reach  Malawi's  borders  for  the  purposes  of  documentary  checks,  but these  do  not  replace  conformity  control  by  the  MBS  (Section 3.1.8).  Malawi  lacks  the administrative capacity to introduce a risk management scheme for the purpose of granting import permits.  The  authorization  and  control  procedure  is  the  same  for  all  imports  irrespective  of  the country of origin (including COMESA/SADC member States).

The  First  Schedule  of  the  Act  lists  all  pests subject to quarantine requirements in Botswana. In addition, Botswana designates certain places as  plant  quarantine  stations,  where  plants  or  plant  products  may  be  kept  for  phytosanitary observation, research, inspection, testing, treatment, detention or destruction; and requires that imported  material  be  kept  or  cultivated  at  a  plant  quarantine  station  or  any  other  location,  and kept  under  supervision  for  as  long  as  it  deems  necessary.  The  owner  or  user  of  any  land  or premises, who knows or suspects of a pest subject to quarantine, should notify the authorities. If the existence of a pest can be determined the premises will be quarantined and, where necessary, infected plants will be destroyed if treatment has failed.', '3.54.  In order to protect plant health, imports of plants and other plant-related material require an import permit and the importation of some plant products is prohibited.55 Import permits are issued  by  the  Division  of  Plant  Protection  under  the  Department  of  Crop  Production.  Efforts  to establish  the  National  Plant  Protection  Organization  (NPPO)  have  been  undermined  by  resource constraints.  Imports  also  require  an  original  phytosanitary  certificate  issued  in  the  country  of origin. If the imported articles are not accompanied by the required documentation they are re-exported or destroyed. In addition, imported plants and plant products are subject to inspection at approved ports of entry and may be disinfected and destroyed if necessary.56', '3.55.  Disease  prevention  and  control  continues  to  be  based  on  the  Diseases  of  Animals  Act  of 1977 (as amended). As in the case of plants and plant products, any person who suspects or has reason to suspect that animals are affected by a disease needs to report it immediately, and as far as possible keep the animals separated. If an area is declared as infected no animals should be moved  from  or  into  that  area,  without  being  previously  disinfected  and  granted  a  written permission  from  a  veterinary  officer.  The  Director  of  Veterinary  Services  is  required  to  issue  an import  (export)  permit  for  any  animal,  animal  product,  or  other  pathogenic  agent  capable  of causing diseases in animals. In addition Botswana applies strict controls at the borders including, inter alia, quarantine, testing and inoculation of suspected animals. As part of the disease control strategy,  the  country  is  divided  into  fenced-off  control  zones.  These  are:  the  OIE-recognized FMD-free area (no buffalo may enter) and the livestock-free areas (no livestock may enter). The principle is to separate livestock and buffalo, vaccinate cattle at risk and keep them separate from OIE-recognized FMD-free cattle. The movement of animals is also controlled.

These  measures  are  expected  to  have  a  limited  duration;  they require legislation and parliamentary approval to become permanent.', '3.78.  Although there are no written guidelines for the adoption of SPS measures, the authorities indicated that it is based on a review of the risks involved, both in scientific and economic terms, of  not  taking  any  action.  However,  there  is  no  mechanism  to  inform  national  stakeholders  and trading partners prior to the adoption of the measures, and consequently, there is no provision for the  solicitation  or  consideration  of  comments  prior  to  their  entry  into  force.  This  is  the  case  for both  emergency  and  permanent  measures.  Notification  to  stakeholders  takes  place  after  the implementation of a measure through its publication in the Gazette. Measures are also advertised through the media, postings at the air- and seaports, and in meetings of the Caribbean Veterinary Association.  In  the  course  of  the  previous  Review,  the  authorities  indicated  that  there  were  no plans to change the procedures for  adopting or  publicizing SPS measures. This seems  to be the current  situation,  which  prevents  St.  Kitts  and  Nevis  from  complying  with  several  of  the requirements of Annex B of the SPS Agreement.', '3.79.
