The  Government  of  Ghana  has  started  to  make  the  considerable  efforts  that  are  currently required to facilitate import procedures, so as to bring them into accordance with the standards of a  modern  economy.  These  efforts  are  taking  place  both  autonomously  and under  the  WTO.  The implementation  of  the  recent  Agreement  on  Trade  Facilitation  would  help.  Particular  efforts  are needed  in  the  following  areas  which  have  been  most  problematic:  slow  customs  clearance, duplication  of  agencies  involved  in  the  importation  process,  duplication  of  documentation; antiquated legislation; duplication in technical conformity assessment agencies; and inefficient port clearance processes. As a result, companies complain about cumbersome import processes which frequently  take  more  than  the  statutory  five  days,  and  therefore  trigger  additional  demurrage costs (section 4.7.3.3), which add to the cost of imports.', '3.4.  The  main  actors  in  the  import  process  are  the  Customs  Division  of  the  Ghana  Revenue Authority  (hereafter  ""Customs"");  the  destination  inspection  companies  (DICs);  the  Ministry  of Trade  and  Industry  (MOTI);  the  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA);  the  Ghana  Standards Authority (GSA); and the Ghana Port Authority. In the context of this review, a large number of other fee-collecting entities have been identified with the same task of controlling compliance with import procedures, including a joint revenue task force, a presidential task force and the national security  personnel.  These  would  benefit  from  rationalization  as  they  slow  the  clearance  process and increase its cost.', '3.5.  Since 2001, the Ghana Community Network (GCNet) system is a public-private partnership that acts as a ""single window"" platform for Customs, at a cost of 0.4% of the value of imports, payable by the importer.2 According to Customs, in part because of connectivity problems, manual processing of customs declarations is quite frequent, and the GCNet system needs to be upgraded and  updated.  Also,  there  is  currently  no  link  between  GCNet  and  the  ASYCUDA  operated  by neighbouring countries. According to the authorities, however, it would be possible to export (and import)  data  across  the  two  softwares  if  appropriate  legal  and  administrative  mechanisms  were put in place.', '3.6.  Since  April  2000,  a  compulsory  Destination  Inspection  Scheme  has  replaced  pre-shipment inspection,  with  the  result  that  this  inspection  is  carried  out  at  arrival.  In  2013,  five  different destination  inspection  companies  (DIC)  shared  the  market  according  to  the  country  of  origin  of imports:  BIVAC,  GSL,  Ghana  LINK,  ICS,  and  WEBB  FONTAINE.3  Inspection  is  mandatory  for  all', '1 World Bank (2012b). 2 GCNet online information.

The compliance and verification work of the DICs largely duplicates the work of Customs. In its 2012 Budget Statement, the Government announced its intention not to renew the contracts of the DICs when they expire in 2015, and to rely exclusively on Customs to inspect imports.', ""3.7.  The  main  legislation  governing  import  procedures  is  the  Customs,  Excise  and  Preventive Service (CEPS) Law (Management) (Duties, Rates and Other Taxes) of 1994, and the Export and Import Act 1995 (Act 503). These texts are not apparently available on any official website, nor are they available electronically. According to the authorities, the CEPS law has been under review for  some  time.  In  June  2013,  in  order  to improve  transparency,  Customs published  a new  book entitled  the  2012  Customs  Tariff  Schedules,  based  on  the  new  HS2012  classification.  This document  consolidates  most  of  the  border  measures  that  were  maintained  by  Ghana  as  at end-2012.  Neither  this  document  nor  Ghana's  tariff  are  available  on  an  official  website.  No legislation apparently regulates the use of scanners."", '3.8.  The documents that are currently required overlap each other and, for this reason, deserve to  be  rationalized  so  as  to  speed  the  import  process,  thus  facilitating  trade.  The  following documents contain duplicate information:', '\uf0b7', '\uf0b7', '\uf0b7', '\uf0b7', 'the Import Declaration Form (IDF);', 'the Final Classification and Valuation Report (FCVR);', 'the Customs Declaration; and', 'the Supplementary Information Document (SID).5', ""3.9.  Further,  imports  must  also  be  accompanied  by  a  tax  clearance  certificate  issued  by  the Internal Revenue Service on the basis of the importer's TIN; this certificate attests compliance by taxpayers with income tax obligations. Since 2001, a fee of 1% of the c.i.f. value is payable on goods imported in commercial quantities that are not covered by a valid certificate."", ""3.10.  Two parallel import management systems currently operate at Ghana's Customs, one run by Customs, and another operated by the DICs. The two entities are involved in both documentary inspection  and  in  the  examination  process.  This  causes  duplication  as  importers  or  their  agents have to re-key the same information in both the FCVR and also into Customs Declarations. Both Customs  and  the  inspection  companies  may  delay  clearance  because  of  missing  or  inaccurate documents, examination of samples, etc."", '3.11.  The goods to be cleared are directed by the DICs (on the basis of the FCVR) to one of the clearance channels (Green, Yellow, or Red). The yellow channel involves more intensive scrutiny of documents than the Green channel and, in principle, scanning (see below). Goods are directed to the red channel by Customs if they are classified as ""high risk goods"" (HRGs), defined under the Export and Import Act of 1995, to which special clearing and control procedures apply for health and security reasons (section 3.3.1).', '3.12.  The outcome of these procedures is that a particularly large share of imports (about 50% of consignments)  are  still  subject  to  physical  inspection  of  goods,  although  no  statistics  were available on this matter in the context of this review; however, Customs have indicated that the aim is to reduce this share to 20%. As the goods have to be moved from one inspecting agency to the  other  for  the  examinations  to  take  place,  discrepancies  in  their  working  hours  cause  long delays, not to mention divergences between examination results.', '3.13.  Although scanners have been installed at Tema Port to facilitate examination, the process leading to the scanning needs improvement. Containers, when they are offloaded from ships, are', '4 Below this threshold, an abridged FCVR may be submitted. In addition, a ""head load"" option for land borders was introduced in October 2007, waiving the destination inspection requirement for imports of single items and of goods in very small quantities.', '5 COTECNA (2012), Ghana Export Guidelines, February.

This  not  only causes delays but also additional costs to the importer, who has to pay not only for the moving of goods, but also for the Ghana Integrated Cargo Clearance System (GICCS)6 tracking device, when the goods, are being returned into the Port for scanning.', '3.14.  As a result of these inefficiencies, customs clearance alone usually takes between one and three  days,  and  may  reach  a  staggering  seven  days,  as  witnessed  in  Aflao.7  Delays  and bottlenecks  in  the  clearance  process  have  thus  increased  the  costs  of  importing  in  recent  years (Table  2.3).  A  ""Gold  Card""  form  of  Authorized  Economic  Operators  was  progressively  being introduced,  which  would  give  some  selected  importers  the  opportunity  to  avoid  the  intrusive physical examination of goods, and access to a truly paperless transaction system.', '3.15.  Finally, the authorities also identified a serious weakness in the import process as it stood in early  2014.  For  example,  under  the  ""Premises  examination""  system,  post-clearance  verification may  be  carried  out  by  Customs  at  the  importer\'s  premises.  Under  the  ""Clearance  on  permit"" facility, consignments can be removed from the port without applicable duties being paid, pending subsequent parliamentary approval. The use of both facilities was curtailed in 2013, after they had been widely abused, resulting in considerable losses of Customs revenue.', '3.16.  No statistics were made available on the use of appeals against customs decisions. These are to be lodged with the Commissioner of Customs, and thereafter with the Committee of Appeals in the Ministry of Trade and Industry.', '3.17.  Ghana has reportedly been implementing the WTO Agreement on Customs Valuation since April 2000, although the underlying legislation has yet to be adopted. It has not been possible to obtain the legislation and applicable regulations under which the DICs operate; according to the authorities, they are contractually responsible for verifying the valuation of imported goods. The DICs  maintain  databases  on  reference  values  and send  their  import  price  data  to  Customs  on  a regular basis.']"

The  inspection  is  free  of  charge  at  the  customs.  If  the  image  raises doubts,  the  goods  undergo  a  physical  inspection  for  the  purposes  of  confirmation.
