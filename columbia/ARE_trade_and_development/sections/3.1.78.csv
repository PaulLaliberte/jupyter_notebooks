National  provisions  apply  to  packaging  whether  it  is  manufactured  or  used  locally  or imported.  They  are  intended  to  guarantee  people's  personal  safety  and  security  and  protect  the environment.  Accordingly,  materials used  for  packaging  must  not  present  any  risk  of leakage  of the substances they contain and, if their condition deteriorates over time, the packaging must be clearly labelled to that effect. The legislation also provides that the packaging must be reusable, recyclable  and/or  biodegradable.  According  to  the  authorities,  the  DRC's  current  legislation  was drawn up in conformity with the technical regulations of ISO and the World Packaging Organisation (WPO).

The labelling on any food product must include: a description of the product; a list of all the ingredients (in decreasing order  in  terms  of  quantity);  the  use-by  and  the  best-before  date;  the  quantity  of  the  product expressed  in  terms  of  volume  or  weight;  the  volume  of  alcohol  (where  appropriate);  the  batch', '39 Interministerial Orders No. CAB/MIN/AGRI/2013 and No. 1016.CAB/MIN/FINANCES/2013 of', '3 September 2013 establishing the rates of the duties, taxes and charges to be levied at the initiative of the Ministry of Agriculture.', '40 Ministerial Order No. 409/CAB/MIN/TC/0082/2006 of 18 July 2006.', '\x0cWT/TPR/S/339 • Democratic Republic of the Congo', '- 55 -', 'number; and the name or corporate name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer or seller.41', '3.102.

Food  and  other  edible products may not be imported if, on the date of arrival at the point of entry into the DRC, less than a quarter of their shelf life remains; for pharmaceutical and cosmetic products, the corresponding threshold is 50% of the shelf life, with a minimum of six months.']"
