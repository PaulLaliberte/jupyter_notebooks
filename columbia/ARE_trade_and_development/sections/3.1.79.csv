Merchandise imports into (and exports from) Myanmar are governed under the Sea Customs Act  (1878),  Land  Customs  Act  (1924),  the  Export  Import  Law  2012,  and  the  Tariff  Law  (1992). The acts and laws are administered by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Commerce.', '3.2.  Under  the  present  laws  and  regulations,  to  be  able  to  import,  an  importer  must  register  a company  that  is  to  engage  in  trade  with  the  Directorate  of  Investment  and  Company Administration,  Ministry  of  National  Planning  and  Economic  Development,  and  register  as  a ""trader"" with the Directorate of Trade of the Ministry of Commerce. The importer is also required to  join  the  Union  of  Myanmar  Federation  of  Chambers  of  Commerce  and  Industry  (UMFCCI). Currently, only Myanmar nationals are allowed to engage in trade, except for imports of inputs and exports of processed goods by manufacturing firms that have been registered under the Foreign Investment Law and consequently also registered as an importer and exporter with the Directorate of Trade.', '3.3.  All  imports  must  be  declared  on  an  import  declaration  form  (CUSDEC-1)  and,  where applicable, be accompanied by an import licence.1 Import licences are issued by the Department of Commerce  and  Consumer  Affairs,  which  is  part  of  the  Ministry  of  Commerce.  In  certain  cases, import  licences  are  issued  based  on  recommendations  provided  by  relevant  ministries  and associations under the UMFCCI. Also required are an invoice, bill of lading or air consignment note, packing list, and any other certificates or permits issued by relevant government departments (for example  SPS  certificates  from  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Irrigation,  for  the  import  of  live plants  and  animals,  and  a  certificate  from  the  Food  and  Drug  Administration  for  the  import  of medicines and foodstuff).', '3.4.  The  required  documents  must  be  submitted  to  Customs  before  the  arrival  of  the  goods. Customs  assessment  takes  two  hours,  on  average,  and  classification  is  based  on  the  Customs Tariff  of  Myanmar  (2012),  which  uses  both  the  ASEAN  harmonized  nomenclature  and  WCO harmonized  system.  Myanmar  does  not  apply  the  provisions  of  the  WTO  Customs  Valuation Agreement. Customs valuation is based on the ""real value"", which is taken to be the normal price or import value of goods at the time and place of importation.2 Import duties are charged on the c.i.f.  price  (real  value).  After  Customs  has  assessed  the  duty  payable,  the  importer  may  pay  in cash  or  a  payment  order  or  through  a  direct  debit  from  a  current  account.  However,  cash payments are only permitted if the assessed duty is less than K 5,000. Customs duty in excess of K 5,000  needs  to  be  made  by  a  payment  order.  Additionally,  importers  and  joint-venture enterprises may open current deposit accounts with the Customs Department. The customs duties and  other  taxes  levied  on  imports  (section  3.1.5)  may  be  deducted  from  these  accounts.  The authorities  stated  that  prior  to  the  exchange  rate  unification,  a  constant  rate  of  K  450/US$  was used  as  the  exchange  rate  for  miscellaneous  imported  goods.  In  2011,  the  Central  Bank  of Myanmar (CBM) issued a daily rate, which was applied to the import of cars, vehicles, and spare parts. Since the exchange rate unification on 1 April 2012, the daily exchange rate issued by the CBM  has  been  used  for  duty  assessment.  The  authorities  state  that  about  10%  of  imports  are physically  examined  at  the  port.  Currently,  customs  clearance  requires  about  three  days;  the authorities intend to implement the ASEAN single window by 2015.', '3.5.  Under the current legislation, importers have the right of appeal against decisions or orders by  customs  officers.  In  the  first  instance,  the  importer  may  lodge  an  appeal  with  the  Revenue Appellate Tribunal within one month after the decision; under certain circumstances (such as being', '1 In April 2013, import licensing requirements were abolished for 166 import commodities,', 'corresponding to more than 1,900 tariff lines.', '2 The authorities state that the real value is defined as ""the wholesale cash price less trade discount, for', 'which goods of the like kind and quality are sold, or are capable of being sold, at the time and place of importation or exportation, as the case may be, without any abatement or deduction whatever, except (in the case of goods imported) of the amount of (the sale tax and of) the duties payable on the importation thereof: or where such price is not ascertainable, the cost at which goods of the like kind and quality could be delivered at such place, without any abatement or deduction except as aforesaid.""', '\x0cWT/TPR/S/293 • Myanmar', '- 33 -', 'hospitalized or arrested) the deadline may be extended to three months. The tribunal may alter, annul or uphold the original decision; however, it cannot impose a greater penalty or confiscation amount than assigned in the original order. Additionally, a customs officer, the Minister of Finance and Revenue, and the President of Myanmar may, of their own accord or in response to a petition by any party, modify, reverse or uphold any of their own decisions or those taken by any of their predecessors.  Furthermore,  the  Director-General  of  Customs  and  the  President  of  the  Union  of Myanmar may summon the record of any case disposed of by an officer subordinate to them (in the  case  of  the  latter  this  includes  the  Minister  of  Finance).  Fines  vary  according  to  the  case. Between 2006 and 2011, there were 150 appeals, all of were ruled against the defendant.', '3.6.  Myanmar does not impose pre-shipment inspection requirements on imports.']"
