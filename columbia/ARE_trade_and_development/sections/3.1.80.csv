Imports  are  subject  to  an  Administrative  Charge  for  Customs  Services  (TASA)  amounting to B 100  (increased  from  B 70  by  Cabinet  Decree  No. 5  of  2014)  for  each  customs  declaration covering goods imports with a total c.i.f. value of B 2,000 or more. The TASA is collected by ANA. There is also a charge of B 3.00 per declaration for use of the customs computer system.', '35 Article 246 of Cabinet Decree No. 41 of 11 December 2002. 36 The preferential tariffs for a further five countries within the LAIA framework had not yet come into', 'force at the time of writing (April 2014).', '\x0cWT/TPR/S/301 • Panama', '- 53 -', '3.71.  In the same way as domestic products, the following indirect taxes are imposed on imports: the ITBMS and the ISC. The ICCDP applies at a different rate to fuel mixed with ethanol imported from abroad (see paragraph 3.79 below).', '3.72.  The  ITBMS  is  a  value  added  sales  tax  and  applies  to  imported  goods,  products  sold  and services provided in Panama. For products, the tax base is the price on the invoice, including all costs  charged  to  the  buyer,  while  for  services  it  is  the  price  agreed  for  providing  the  service. The tax  base  for  imports  is  the  c.i.f.  price,  plus  the  tariff  and  other  customs  taxes  and  charges imposed on imports. The ITBMS on imports is paid at the time the declaration is submitted and the duty paid. The general rate for the ITBMS is 7% (it rose by 5% on 1 July 2010).37 Higher rates apply to alcoholic beverages (10%), cigarettes and other tobacco products (15%) and hotel and accommodation services (10%). Moreover, since 1 September 2013, a 15% ITBMS % has applied to  pure  ethyl  alcohol  and  absolute  alcohol  to  be  used  to  produce  fuel.38  The  tax  on  fuel consumption for petrol and diesel fuel containing bioethanol has also been increased.', ""3.73.  Some goods  and services are exempt from the ITBMS, for example, agricultural and food products, crude oil and its byproducts, pharmaceuticals, the transfer of goods and services within free  and  customs  zones,  health  and  education  services,  the  generation,  transmission  and distribution  of  electricity,  freight,  transport  of  freight,  air,  maritime  and  land  transport of passengers,  loading,  unloading  and  transfer  and  auxiliary  loading  services  in  ports,  together with  repair,  maintenance  and  auxiliary  services  supplied  to  ships  in  transit  through  Panama's territorial  waters.  In  October 2013,  imports  of  aircraft  and  vessels  of  tariff  headings  88.02 and 89.03 also became exempt from payment of the ITBMS."", '3.74.  The ISC applies to the sale of certain Panamanian and imported products and services for consumption, including aerated beverages, syrups, alcoholic beverages (spirits, wines and beers), tobacco  products,  automobiles,  motor  cycles,  boats,  aircraft,  jewellery,  cable,  microwave  and satellite television services and mobile telephony. The tax base is the price upon first sale from the manufacturer  (including  all  costs  charged  to  the  buyer)  or  the  cost  of  providing  the  service. For imports,  the  tax  base  is  the  c.i.f.  value  plus  the  tariff  and  other  taxes  and  charges  levied by the  Customs  on  imports.  ANIP  is  responsible  for  collecting  the  ISC  at  a  basic  rate  of  5%, although  higher  rates  apply  to  products  such  as  tobacco  (32.5%)  and  alcoholic  beverages, to which a fixed amount is applied depending on the price and alcohol content per litre.', ""3.75.  Law  No. 8  of  15 March 2010  (Article  143)  increased  the  ISC  to  10%  for:  motor  cycles (over 125 cc), outboard engines (over 75 cc), yachts, sailboats or recreational craft, jet skis, ships, aircraft  and  helicopters  for  non-commercial  use,  syrups  for  manufacturing  beverages,  jewellery and  firearms.  The  Law  also  modified  the  ISC  rates  for  self-propelled  land  vehicles  (which  now range from 5% to 25%) and made imported vehicles subject to a minimum rate of B 500; for used vehicles,  the  law  provides  for  a  minimum  tax  ranging  from  B 750  to  B 1,500  depending  on  the vehicle's age. The authorities have indicated that the purpose of imposing new ISC rates on motor vehicles is to compensate for the removal of the tariffs on them. Law No. 8 also imposed the tax on  cable,  microwave  and  satellite  television  services  and  mobile  telephony  services  at  a  rate of 5%. Law No. 52 of 28 August 2012 extended application of the ISC (at a rate of 5%) to a series of  products  of  chapters  HS  84,  85  and  90  such  as  calculators,  telephones,  office  machines, data-processing equipment and various electronic appliances. The authorities have indicated that, in this case as well, the aim is to use the ISC to offset the removal of the tariffs on these products as a result of the WTO Agreement on Information Technology."", '3.76.  Law  No. 15  of  12 March 2013  imposed  a  sizeable  increase  in  ISC  rates  on  alcoholic beverages  depending  on  their  value  and  the  degree  of  alcohol,  applicable  in  particular  to  those with the highest prices, usually imported beverages. Pursuant to Law No. 76 of 21 October 2013, the ISC was abolished for boats or craft for pleasure or sports (HS 89.03). During the period under review, the provision allowing a reduced ISC by year of ageing for domestically produced spirits was eliminated.', ""3.77.  Goods going abroad and sold directly to passengers and crew of ships and aircraft engaged in  international  transport  and  sales  for  export,  as  well  as  sales  to  companies  established in Panama's free zones, are not subject to payment of the ISC."", '37 Law No. 8 of 15 March 2010. 38 Tariff headings 2207.10.11 and 2207.10.91, pursuant to Law No. 76 of 21 October 2013.', '\x0cWT/TPR/S/301 • Panama', '- 54 -', '3.78.  The  ICCDP  applies  to  the  sale  of  such  products  in  Panama.

In  fact,  Law  No. 76  of  21 October 2013  set  the  ICCDP  at  a  rate  of  B 3.78  per  gallon  for petrol  (HS 2710.12.19)  mixed  with  anhydrous  bioethanol  of  foreign  origin and  B 1.58  per  gallon for petrol mixed with biodiesel of foreign origin. At the same time, a B 0.57 lower rate per gallon was set for petrol mixed with 5% of anhydrous bioethanol produced using domestic raw materials, the  rate  being  reduced  in  line  with  the  increase  in  bioethanol  content.  Payment  of  this  tax  was made  retroactive  to  1 September 2013,  the  date  on  which  it  became  mandatory  to  use  5% of bioethanol in 91 and 95 octane petrol in Panama.39 According to statements by the authorities, this  variable  rate  is  intended  to  protect  domestic  production  of  sugar  cane  used  to  produce bioethanol.40 Likewise, in October 2013, the structure of the National Import Tariff was modified in order  to  differentiate  imports  of  pure  ethyl  alcohol  and  absolute  alcohol  to  be  used  to  produce biofuels from those used to prepare other products, and the tariff was raised from 15% to 30%.41']"
