The  Export  Control  System  (ECS)  is  a  trans-European  system  enabling  EU member States to exchange the export declaration data and exit information between the customs office of export and the customs office of exit. The ECS covers indirect exports, where goods are exported  from  one  member  State  and  exit  the  customs  territory  of  the  Union  from  another member State, meaning that the Office of Export and the Office of Exit are located in two different member States. For indirect exports, the usage of the ECS  has been mandatory since July 2009. Direct  exports,  where  the  Office  of  Export  and  Office  of  Exit  are  in  the  same  member  State,  are handled  by  the  National  Export  System  of  each  member  State.
