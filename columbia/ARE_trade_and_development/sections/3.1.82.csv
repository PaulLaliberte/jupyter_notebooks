The  SIDF  loan  provides  a  maximum  term  of  15  years covering up to 50% of the fixed assets, pre-operating expenses and start-up working capital47; for projects in less developed or remote cities, the term may be extended to 20 years and the loan may be increased up to 75%.48 According to the authorities, the fees paid to SIDF on loans are similar to, and in some cases higher, than the interest charged by comparable commercial banks.
