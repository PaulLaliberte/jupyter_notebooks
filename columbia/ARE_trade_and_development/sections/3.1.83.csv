The merchandise preshipment inspection programme has been in force in Chad since 2003. It aims  to  reduce  the  risks  of  fraud  and  guarantee  customs  revenues.  Inspection  is  obligatory for imports  from  all  countries,  and  is  carried  out  by  the  company  Bureau  Veritas  B.I.V.A.C. BV (BIVAC).  It  covers  merchandise  imports  of  an  f.o.b.  value  of  CFAF 2 million  (around €3,049)45 or more, and aims to verify the value, quality, quantity of the goods in question.', ""3.10.  To set the inspection procedure in motion, the importer must notify BIVAC of its intention to import (through the prior import declaration (DPI)), and present the supplier's pro forma invoice. It  must  then  pay  the  inspection  fee  of  0.90%  of  the  f.o.b.  value  of  the  goods,  as  specified in the supplier's  pro  forma  invoice,  subject  to  a  minimum  of  CFAF  100,00046  corresponding to an ad valorem  fee  of  5%  in  the  case  of  imports  at  the  minimum  threshold  of  CFAF  2 million. This standard amount is one of the highest in the subregion (common report, Chapter 3). Once the expenses  have  been  paid,  the  importer  returns  to  the  inspection  company  with  two  copies of the pro  forma  invoice,  the  DPI  and  the  bank  receipt,  for  the  purpose  of  issuing  an intention-to-import document (IDI). The IDI is valid for six months and can be extended once for a further three months.47"", ""3.11.  The  inspection  is  performed  in  the  supplier's  country  by  an  agent  of  the  inspection company.  If  the  inspection  is  considered  satisfactory,  a  verification  certificate  is  issued to the importer  and  a  copy  sent  on  line  to  the  customs  authorities.  This  certificate  contains the indicative  elements  needed  to  identify  and  determine  the  customs  value  of  the  goods, but the customs authorities are not obliged to take this information into account."", '3.12.  Imports  may  not  be  subdivided  for  the  purpose  of  avoiding  preshipment  inspection and an at-destination inspection  can be  called  for  if  any  suspicions  are  aroused.  The  fee  for  this verification is CFAF 24,000, payable by the operator. If at the end of the inspection, the company concludes  that  the  imports  have  been  split  up,  a  new  inspection  is  ordered.  This  time,  the  fee is 0.90%  of  the  overall  value  of  the  undivided  merchandise,  subject  to  a  minimum of CFAF 100,000 - in other words the normal charges.', ""3.13.  Apart  from  imports  worth  less  than  CFAF  2 million,  the  following  goods  are  exempt from preshipment  inspection48:  gold  and  precious  stones,  objets  d'art;  crude  oil  and  refined products; explosives and pyrotechnical devices; arms and ammunition; live animals, fresh eggs; fruit  and  vegetables,  recycled  metals;  newspapers  and  magazines;  goods  reimported by the Government;  household  removals  and  personal  effects;  non-commercial  postal  packages; commercial samples; gifts from foreign governments or international organizations to foundations, charitable  bodies  and  recognized  humanitarian  organizations;  disaster  aid  from  foreign governments, foreign organizations or private individuals; personal gifts sent by foreign residents to  their  relatives  in  Chad,  for  their  personal  use;  and  supplies  and  gifts  imported  by  diplomatic and consular missions and international organizations for their own requirements."", '3.14.  Since  December 2011,  an  at-destination  verification  programme  has  been  compulsory for imported goods that have not previously undergone preshipment inspection (Box 3.1).', '45 Decree No. 521/PR/MEF/2003 of 18 December 2003 establishing a mandatory verification programme', 'for goods imported into the Republic of Chad.', '46 Annex B of the contract between the Republic of Chad and Bureau Veritas BIVAC BV,', 'signed on17 November 2003.', '47 Online information from Bureau Veritas BIVAC BV.

Inspection is conducted by the company Cotecna Inspection  SA,  under  a  seven-year  contract.  It  usually  covers  the  quality  and  quantity of the goods,  the  customs  value,  and  the  customs  classification.  Following  the  inspection, the company issues a verification certificate that is supposed to contain information enabling the customs authority to identify the goods and determine their value. As in the case for preshipment inspection,  this  information  is  only  indicative  and  does  not  commit  the  customs  authorities. The certificate is obligatory at the time of customs clearance. There is no exemption threshold. For goods with an f.o.b. value set by the inspection company at over CFAF 2 million, the inspection fee of 0.90% of this amount is calculated in the same way as  the  preshipment  inspection  fee,  except  that  the  base  of  the  calculation  is  the  f.o.b.  value established  at  the  time  of  the  verification.  For  merchandise  worth  less  than  CFAF  2 million, the fee is CFAF 24,000 per declaration. This in practice annuls the exemption from preshipment inspection agreed upon for imports of less than CFAF 2 million. The list of exempted products is shorter than in the case of preshipment inspection and includes the  following:  arms  and  ammunition,  other  than  those  for  hunting  and  sporting  activities; live animals, fresh eggs, fresh fruit, vegetables and fruit products; gifts from foreign governments or international  organizations  to  foundations,  charitable  bodies  and  recognized  humanitarian organizations; disaster aid from foreign governments, foreign organizations or private individuals; personal  gifts  sent  by  foreign  residents  to  their  relatives  in  Chad,  for  their  personal  use; and supplies  and  gifts  imported  by  diplomatic  and  consular  missions  and  international organizations for their own requirements.
