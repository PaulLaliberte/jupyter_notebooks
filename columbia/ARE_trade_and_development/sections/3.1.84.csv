Article  5  of  the  Law  requires  the  Federal  Council  to  review periodically,  i.e.  at  least  every  six  years,  subsidies  accorded  by  the  Federal  Government  with  a focus  on  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  individual  programmes.  The  Federal  Council  report published in May 2008 evaluated 228 subsidy programmes (out of 361). The report recommended the termination or revision of 70 programmes, as these were found to have become redundant due to structural changes or inefficient relative to their stated goals.', ""3.87.

In  September  2014, Parliament  amended  the  reporting  requirements  under  the  Federal  Law  on  Financial  Support  and Subsidies.  The  subsidy  examination  process  has  been  simplified,  but  is  not  intended  to  be  less rigorous.  Each  year,  starting  from  2014,  one  of  the  seven  federal  departments  reviews  its subsidies.  The  procedure  leads  to  a  six-year  cycle,  during  which  all  subsidies  accorded  by  the Federal Government are examined. The Federal Council presents the results of each year's review in the Swiss state financial statements. The new examination process did not change the purpose of  the  review.  The  focus  is  still  on  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  individual  programmes  as described above."", '3.88.

The average value of tax concessions granted over the period 2008-12 is estimated at EC$142.8 million.', '3.91.  St. Kitts and Nevis has, on various occasions, notified to the Committee on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures the Fiscal Incentives Act No. 17 of 1974, and was granted an extension for its modification or elimination until end 2015, under the decision relating to Article 27.4 of the SCM Agreement.38 This is the only subsidies programme notified by St. Kitts and Nevis.

The  length  of  the  tax  holiday  depends  on  the  local value  added  generated  or  on  whether  the  company  exports  all  its  production.  To  this  end, companies are classified as: (i) Group 1 enterprises, where local value is 50% or more of sales, which may be granted a tax holiday of up to 15 years; (ii) Group 2 enterprises, with local value of between 25% and 50% of sales, which are granted concessions for up to 12 years; (iii) Group 3 enterprises,  with  local  value  of  between  10%  and  25%  of  sales,  which  may  benefit  from  a  tax holiday of up to 10 years; and (iv) enclave enterprises, where production is exclusively for export, which may be granted a tax holiday of up to 15 years.', ""3.92.  Additional benefits, in the form of income tax rebates at the termination of the tax holiday period,  are  based  on  the  company's  share  of  export  profits  in  its  total  profits.
