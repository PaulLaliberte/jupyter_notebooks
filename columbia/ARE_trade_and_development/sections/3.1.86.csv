According to both the European Commission and UNCTAD, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  has  a  relatively  well  developed  competition  law  but  an  under-resourced  competition authority  to  implement  it.31  The  Law  for  Protection  of  Competition  (LPC)32,  amended  in  2011  to align  it  with  the  Law  on  General  Administrative  Procedure,  is  in  line  with  the  EU  regulatory framework  and  provides  a  framework  for  the  functioning  of  the  Commission  for  Protection  of Competition  (CPC),  an  independent  state  body  with  the  status  of  a  legal  entity,  as  the  main regulatory and implementing body. It controls, inter alia, the application of the provisions of the LPC, the Law on Control of State Aid and the relevant by-laws, and determines rules and measures for the protection of effective competition. The CPC is empowered to impose sanctions in cases of prohibited agreements, decisions, and concerted practices, abuse of monopoly or dominant market position,  and  failure  to  notify  a  concentration.  The  Commission  is  also  responsible  for  issuing authorization for the concentration of economic activities (e.g. mergers, acquisition of control, joint ventures).', '3.90.  Several by-laws have recently been enacted that transpose relevant EU measures in certain areas, including block exemptions. The Commission notes that ""good progress"" has been made in the  area  of  anti-trust,  including  mergers,  and  the  legislative  framework  has  been  improved through  implementing  legislation.  Also,  the  CPC  is  increasingly  investigating  economically significant sectors, including telecommunications and broadcasting, and its enforcement record has been  improving.  Since  October  2011,  the  CPC  has  adopted  numerous  decisions  on  prohibited agreements,  abuse  of  dominant  position,  concentrations,  and  failure  to  notify  a  concentration. Penalties take the form of fines.', '3.91.  In  2010,  a  new  Law  on  Control  of  State  Aid  was  enacted,  and  two  by-laws  further transposed  relevant  EU  measures  concerning  notification  procedures  for  granting  state  aid  and procedures for monitoring existing state aid. Two further decrees are to be adopted in 2013 to set rules on granting regional horizontal aid, and services of general economic interest, in line with the EU  acquis.  In  2012,  the  CPC  took  ten  decisions  on  state  aid,  including  ex-officio  decisions. According  to  the  Macedonian  authorities,  a  number  of  activities  are  planned  for  2012-2015: enacting regulations for establishing conditions and procedures for granting regional horizontal aid and compensation for services of general economic interest; strengthening the capacity of the CPC to improve its enforcement record in the area of cartels and the quality of state aid decisions; and increasing the number of employees in the field of anti-trust and concentrations.', '3.92.  Regarding  price  controls,  at  the  time  of  its  accession  to  the  WTO,  the  former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia noted that maximum prices were set for a limited number of products and services  important  for  the  living  standard  of  the  population  and  characterized  by  monopolistic supply  conditions. Since  2005,  price  controls  exist  in  the  form  of  regulated  and  approved  prices but  not  in  the  form  of  direct  control.  Prices  in  the  energy  sector  (oil  derivatives,  electricity, heating) as well as prices of telecommunication services (fixed line) are controlled by independent regulatory bodies.', '3.93.  The  Energy  Regulatory  Commission  (ERC)  regulates  energy-related  activities.  Pursuant  to the Energy Law, the price of natural gas and the services connected with its supply and delivery to the consumer is determined by ERC decisions. In the telecom sector, prices are regulated by the national regulatory authority.', '30  According  to  the  authorities,  only  two  companies  received  regional  state  aid  in  2010:  Johnson Controls  and  Matthey,  both  manufacturers  of  automotive  component.  See  document  G/SCM/Q2/MKD/4, 23 August 2012, Replies to Questions posed by the EU.', '31 European Commission (2012), p. 33; and UNCTAD (2012), p. 55. 32  It  replaced  the  1999  Law  against  Unfair  Competition,  which  was  based  on  the  German  Act  against Restraints  on  Competition,  and  is  considered  to  be  better  adapted  to  the  needs  of  the  country  and  the requirements of the acquis.', '\x0cWT/TPR/S/290 • The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia', '- 54 -']"
