Under Section 25 of the Customs Act, 1962, the central Government may, by notification in the  Official  Gazette,  exempt  generally or  absolutely  or  subject  to  any  stated  conditions, imports from the whole or part of the customs duty leviable. The majority of such tariff concessions are announced with the Annual Budget through a notification by the Ministry of Finance (Department of  Revenue)  and  are  provided  under  the  various  schemes  to  encourage  exports  and  investment (Section 3.3.1). However, tariff concessions and exemptions may also be announced throughout the  year  through  notifications  issued  in  The  Gazette  of  India.  The  concessions  can  be  either product-  and  tariff-line-specific  but  many  are  also  based  on  end-or  industrial-use  and  therefore difficult to include in the overall analysis of the tariff.', '3.32.  According  to  data  provided  by  the  authorities  and  available  in  the  Budget,  total  customs revenue forgone as a result of tariff concessions is around 25% of total revenue; it has been falling from 39% at the time of the previous Review in 2009-10 to 25.3% expected for 2013-14.']"
