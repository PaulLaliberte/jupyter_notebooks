Joint  Executive Decree  No. 22/15,  adopted  on  23 January 2015,  provides  for  the  imposition  of  quotas  for  the import of certain products when domestic production covers over 60% of domestic consumption (Table 3.6). These quotas are supposed to be administered by means of import licences granted subject  to  a  number  of  criteria:  the  percentage  of  a  company's  registered  capital  owned  by Angolans;  the  historical  share  of  imports;  production  and  financial  capacity,  with  a  view  to increasing  domestic  production  and  reducing  imports;  and  the  distribution  chain.  Under  the Decree,  goods  subject  to  a  quota  may  only  be  imported  under  very  specific  conditions (mandatory inspection  at  destination  and  bulk  packaging)  and  through  clearly  identified  entry points;  the  price  control  regime  also  applies  to  their  marketing.

Joint Executive Decree No. 2/15, in force since 8 January 2015, bans the import of cement throughout  2015  unless  a  special  authorization  is  granted  by  the  Cement  Sector  Commission. The latter,  after  having  heard  the  opinion  of  the  Angolan  Cement  Industry  Association  (AICA), determines and allocates the quotas for production/supply and ensures that the civil engineering and public works market is regularly supplied with cement. Special cements and cement for the border  provinces35  are  exempt  from  this  regime;  nevertheless  both  users  and  provincial governments must obtain a prior authorization. The Cement Sector Commission may grant special authorizations to import cement, for up to 60% of duly substantiated needs, to businesspersons involved in ""turnkey"" projects. Quotas for the import of cement are allocated to domestic cement producers  (actual  or  potential)  and,  on  an  exceptional  basis, to  other  companies. Approved imports are subject to clearly defined requirements (preshipment inspection focusing on quality,  bulk  packaging,  and  justification  of  the  costs  and  the  distribution  chain)  and  must  pass through  clearly  specified  entry  points.  The  marketing  of  imported  cement  is  subject  to geographical  limitations  and  to  a  price  control  mechanism  exercised  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance. The import of clinker required the submission of an annual import plan before 31 January 2015, to be endorsed by the Commission.', '3.38.  In addition, a tariff quota for horse mackerel (peixe carapão) was also established in 2015 (Section 4.1.2).']"
