Mexico  regulates  exports  in  order  to  protect  morals,  security  and  public  order,  as  well  as public  health,  and  to  conserve  natural  resources,  flora  and  fauna.  Exports  are  also  regulated  in order to guarantee supplies of essential consumer goods and raw materials, and to protect assets of  historical,  artistic  or  archaeological  importance.  In  some  instances,  the  procedures  laid  down provide  that  the  COCEX  will  evaluate  studies  prepared  by  departments  proposing  measures  to regulate exports.', '3.113.  As  was  the  case  in  2012,  Mexico  still  bans  the  export  of  certain  chemical  products  and drugs and other products (27 products in the HS 2012 at the eight-digit level), usually for security or public health reasons or in order to comply with international agreements.', '80 In 2016, the DTA applicable to exports was generally Mex$288 (Mex$250 in 2012); this fee may vary', 'depending on the situation (Federal Law on Duty of 31 December 1981, latest amendment published in the Official Journal of 11 August 2014).

Non-automatic  licensing  (prior  permits)  for  exports  is  used  for  the  purpose  of  regulating trade in products in accordance with international treaties or agreements to which Mexico is party, for example, the Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods  and  Technologies;  CITES;  the  Rotterdam  Convention  on  the  Prior  Informed  Consent Procedure  for  Certain  Hazardous  Chemicals  and  Pesticides  in  International  Trade;  and  the Kimberley Process Certification  Scheme. This type of licence may also be used to protect morals, security and public order, public health, the exploitation of natural resources and to conserve flora and fauna, but may not be used to restrict exports. The licensing requirement applies to  products originating  in  any  country  on  the  basis  of  most-favoured-nation  treatment.83  In  2016, non-automatic export licensing applied to 571 tariff lines, mostly chemical products (Chart 3.7).', 'Chart 3.7 Non-automatic export licensing by HS 2016 section', '(Number of tariff lines)', 'Source: WTO Secretariat calculations, based on data provided by the authorities.', ""3.116.

Licences may not be assigned, but may be extended up to three times provided that the party concerned can prove that the goods have been shipped during the licence's term of validity, which  is  usually  one  year.  Some  licences  may  be  for  a  longer  period,  for  example,  for  certain hydrocarbons and petroleum products the term is 20 years and they may only be extended once for up to half the original term."", '3.117.  Non-automatic licences are processed using the Digital Window and are issued by different bodies  depending  on  the  product  concerned  and  according  to  specific  criteria:  for  example, COFEPRIS  and  SEMARNAT  grant  non-automatic  licences  for  the  export  of  pesticides  and  toxic  or hazardous  substances,  while  the  Ministry  of  Energy  (SENER)  issues  those  for  hydrocarbons  and petroleum products.
