Since  the  previous  Review,  the  New  Zealand  Export  Credit  Office  (NZECO)  continues  to provide trade credit insurance and financial guarantee products that complement those available in the private sector for exporters and banks, including against the risk of non-payment arising from defined political or commercial risks (up to 95% cover).', ""3.122.  NZECO  is  currently  located  in  the  Treasury,  and  its  obligations  to  third  parties  are guaranteed  by  the  New  Zealand  Government.  The  Government's  maximum  liability  under  the scheme  is  NZ$740  million.  To  be  eligible  for  NZECO's  guarantees,  an  exporter  must  be  either  a New Zealand registered company, or a subsidiary of a New Zealand registered company located abroad; and an economic benefit to New Zealand must exist from the transaction."", ""3.123.  Traditionally,  the  NZECO  products  relate  to  medium  and  long-term  financing  (between one and  14  years).  However,  in  response  to  the  global  financial  crisis,  NZECO's  mandate  was extended  in  2009  to  cover  short-term  trade  credit  insurance,  which  covers  the  risk  of  a  foreign buyer defaulting on their short-term repayments (less than 360 days), due to specific commercial or  political  events.  NZECO  is  not  mandated  to  compete  with  the  private  insurers  and  can  only provide this product for non-marketable risks and/or where the insurers lack the capacity. During the 2013/2014 financial year, NZECO guaranteed NZ$306 million worth of export transactions in support of 36 exporting companies, of which 74% had annual turnovers of less than NZ$50 million and 62% had annual turnovers of less than NZ$25 million."", '3.124.  According to the authorities, NZECO follows the OECD Arrangement on export credits and pricing, as well as its own Crown mandated criteria and prudential limits.21', ""3.125.  NZECO also provides co-insurance (top-up cover) policies to support the private insurers' capacity."", '21 NZ Export Credit office online information.
