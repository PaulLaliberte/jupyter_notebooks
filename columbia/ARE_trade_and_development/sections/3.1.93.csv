Privatization of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) was relatively rapid and almost completed during the 1990s, mostly through sales to the management and employees of the companies. Out of  around  2,000  SOEs,  fewer  than  70  are  still  not  privatized; according  to  the  authorities,  state capital  in  these  enterprises  as  a  share  of  GDP  is  approximately  15%.  State  capital  remains concentrated  in  the  energy  sector  (power  generation  and  transmission  companies  are  state-owned), public utilities, and public enterprises associated with the railways. The State also owns a significant minority stake in the profitable telecommunications company, Makedonski Telekom.', '3.95.  Pressured  by  the  external  environment  and  insufficient  revenues,  in  common  with  other Balkan  countries,  the  Government  is  seeking  ways  to  attract  FDI,  expand  exports,  increase enterprise efficiency, and ensure financing. Engaging upon a final process of privatization is one possibility  under  consideration.  The  Government  is  looking  for  sources  of  capital  not  only  in  the OECD but also in growing economies such as Turkey, Russia, China, and Azerbaijan.', ""3.96.  After  the  privatization  of  the  telecommunications  industry  and  partial  privatization  of  the energy sector (with the sale through public tender of the national electricity distributor EPCM to EVN from Austria), the Government has plans to restructure and privatize the remaining publicly-held enterprises in the energy, transport, industrial, and health sectors. Restructuring is planned for a number of public enterprises including PE Macedonian Railways; Public Housing Enterprise, PE Macedonian Roads, and the Macedonian Post. Leading industrial companies among the announced privatizations are: chemicals producer JSC OHIS, which is 76% state-owned, with 900 employees; cigarette manufacturer TKP Prilep, all preferred shares owned by the State with 1,200 employees; electronics  manufacturer  JSC  EMO  Ohrid,  which  is  65%  state-owned  and  has  1,400  employees; and  military  equipment  producer  JSC  Eurokompozit  Prilep,  100%  state-owned,  with  over  500 employees.  A  number  of  unsuccessful  attempts  have  been  made  to  sell  these  four  companies, which  remain  top  of  the  Government's  privatization  agenda,  although  a  public  call  for  selling government shares in Eurokompozit Prilep will be made."", '3.97.  The main coordinating institution is the governmental Commission for Privatization, and a new Law on State Capital Management is under preparation. Following the termination of the work of  the  Macedonian  Privatization  Agency  (MPA),  its  responsibilities,  assets,  and  employees  were transferred to: the Ministry of Economy, responsible for the finalization of the privatization process in  companies;  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  which  takes  care  of  the  scale  of  state  capital  in  financial institutions; the Pension and Disability Fund, responsible for the management of shares and stakes of the capital transferred to the Fund; and the Public Company for Real Estate, which manages the real estate transferred in ownership to the MPA.']"
