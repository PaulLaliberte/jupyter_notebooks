Importers and customs brokers may set up a pre-payment account with Customs to expedite the settlement of liabilities and refunds; funds deposited in the account may also be used as security for the release of goods pending proper processing of the customs declaration. There are no formal mechanisms for  pre-arrival  processing  of  import-related  documentation  or  the  delivery  of  advance  rulings. VAT-registered  importers  with  an  importation  history  of  at  least  three  years  may  qualify  for expedited  customs  clearance  under  a  Gold  Card  programme,  which  became  operational  in December  2013:  Gold  Card  holders'  consignments  will  not  be  subjected  to  systematic  physical import inspections. Other prerequisites for participation in the programme include: membership of a  reputable  trade  association,  such  as  the  St.  Vincent  and  the  Grenadines  Chamber  of  Industry and  Commerce;  and  a  favourable  business  practice  review  by  the  Customs  and  Excise Department."", ""3.4.  Importers are not formally required to engage the services of customs brokers. According to the authorities, decisions on the licensing of customs brokers are made on a case-by-case basis by the  Comptroller  of  Customs,  taking  into  account  the  applicant's  general  background  and experience.  Most  successful  applicants  are  nationals  of  St.  Vincent  and  the  Grenadines  with  a certain  level  of  relevant  experience,  but  nationals  of  other  OECS/CARICOM  countries  are  also eligible. The authorities have drafted a bill aimed at establishing a formal licensing and regulatory framework  for  customs  brokers;  the  proposal  includes  specific  provisions  governing  brokerage fees, which are currently unregulated."", '3.5.  Import declarations may be assigned into one of four lanes: green (immediate release), blue (post-clearance check), yellow (documentary check) and red (documentary and physical checks). According  to  the  authorities,  the  green  lane is  primarily  used  for  non-commercial imports,  while most  commercial  imports  are  channelled  into  either  the  yellow or  the  red  lane.  In  principle,  the relevant selectivity criteria are reviewed at least once a year. A 2012 evaluation using the Customs Assessment Trade Toolkit (CATT) found that the risk management system was weak and physical inspections  remained  excessive;  deficiencies  were  also  flagged  in  cargo  control,  standard operational rules, internal and external feedback mechanisms, and information sharing with other government agencies (Inland Revenue, Immigration, Health and Agriculture).19', '19 Government of St. Vincent and the Grenadines (2013).', '\x0cWT/TPR/S/299 • Saint Vincent and the Grenadines', '- 352 -', '3.6.  No  time-release  studies  have  been  carried  out  at  Customs;  according  to  the  authorities, imports  are  typically  cleared  within  48  hours.  The  2013  World  Bank  Doing  Business  survey estimates the average time for customs clearance and technical control at 2 days.20']"
