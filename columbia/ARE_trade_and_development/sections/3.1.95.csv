Duty rebates and drawback are provided in Botswana to stimulate production and exports by reducing the costs of inputs. Rebate item 470 is a SACU industrial incentive programme which covers  all  goods  produced  exclusively  for  export  outside  SACU.  Registered  companies  are exempted from duty on raw materials used in the manufacturing, processing, finishing, equipping or  packaging  of  goods  exclusively  for  export.

In 2010, the percentage of the sales value of proven exports was 25% for clothing and accessories; 17.5% for household textiles; 12.5% for fabrics and other textiles, and 8% for yarn.72', '3.75.
