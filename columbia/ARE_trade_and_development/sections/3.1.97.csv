However, the Directorate of International Trade under the Division of Trade Promotion has an Export Marketing Assistance Programme (EMAP). The objective of EMAP is to assist exporters of Namibian manufactured products in developing new export markets. The programme is aimed at promoting  and  expanding  trade  and  related  activities  through  assisting  exporting  manufacturers in:  engaging  in  primary  market  research,  attending  trade  fairs  and  exhibitions  regionally  and internationally, and engaging in any other related activities that may further the objectives of the programme.', '3.68.

Namibia's  Export  Processing  Zones  Act  dates  back  to  1995  (Act  No.  9  of  1995,  as amended).  EPZ  status  is  not  confined  to  a  specific  area  or  region.  Enterprises  that  undertake manufacturing or assembly operations must export 100% in the first year of production. However, after  having  been  in  operation  for  at  least  a  year,  an  EPZ  enterprise  may  apply  for  special consideration  and  permission  to  sell  up  to  a  maximum  of  30%  of  its  previous  year's  production output in the domestic (SACU) market. Thereafter they can apply to export not less than 70% of their production, earn foreign exchange and employ Namibians. EPZ enterprises may hold foreign currency  accounts  and  repatriate  capital  and  profits.  Tax  incentives  for  EPZ  enterprises  include exemption from corporate tax, import tax, sales tax, and stamp and transfer duties on goods and services required for EPZ activities. These benefits are limited to a period of ten years."", '3.72.  EPZ enterprises are free to establish themselves anywhere in the country. An EPZ enterprise can set up as a single factory enterprise at any clearly demarcated location of choice. The main focus  of  the  EPZ  is  on  export-oriented  manufacturing  activities,  excluding  fish  and  meat processing. Extractive operations such as mining and fishing are not eligible. All mining operations are taxable under the normal tax regime. However, mineral processing or beneficiation operations may  be  considered  and  granted  EPZ  status.  For  purposes  of  incentive  administration  and monitoring, there has to be a clear separation between the mineral processing EPZ enterprise and any other entities with which that enterprise is doing business or to which it is linked, in terms of business registration and identity, operations and management structures.', '3.73.  The ODC (together with NIC) is responsible for the administration of EPZs and develops and leases  serviced  industrial  and  business  sites  and  factory  shells.  The  role  and  nature  of  ODC  is currently  under  review  and  may  be  merged  with  another  entity.  The  Customs  and  Excise Department  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  monitors  the  movements  of  inputs  and  outputs  from  EPZ enterprises  to  ensure  export  obligations  are  met.

A  project  seeking  EPZ-enterprise  status  must  be  a  green-field  project  and  the  applicant must  be  incorporated  as  a  new  company  under  the  Companies  Act.  A  brown-field  project  or operating company cannot convert to an EPZ enterprise. A comprehensive business plan and EPZ application  forms,  which  are  available  in  paper  or  electronic  format,  should  be  submitted  to  the ODC. The ODC works in consultation with the Namibia Investment Centre, the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Namibia to consider the application against the criteria of the EPZ Act. Projects that meet the qualifying conditions for admission under the EPZ are referred to the EPZ Committee for final consideration and approval. The Committee consists of the Minister of Trade and Industry, the Minister of Finance and the Governor of the Bank of Namibia, assisted by the ODC and officials drawn from other Ministries and agencies. An approved applicant is issued with an EPZ certificate signed by the Minister of Trade and Industry. The certificate sets out the terms and conditions of admission to operate as an EPZ enterprise.', '3.75.  A  report  by  ODC  on  the  performance  of  EPZs  from  1997-2012  showed  that  Namibia  has attracted  investment  in  diverse  economic  activities  which  include  manufacturing  of  automotive parts,  marine  ropes  and  cordages,  household  plastic  products,  abrasive  products  and  tobacco; motor  vehicle  assembly;  mineral  processing  such  as  zinc  and  copper  refinery;  and  cutting  and polishing  of  diamonds,  marble  and  granite.  Some  80%  of  registered  and  operational EPZ enterprises are engaged in mineral processing, followed by 15% in general manufacturing and the remainder in assembly operations (Table 3.2).

A  recent  study  argues  that  EPZs  in  Namibia  have  not  met  expectations  in  terms  of  job creation.  Factors  such  as  the  continuous  increase  in  fuel  prices  and  the  resultant  high  costs  of transport and logistics, comparatively high wages, and perceived low labour productivity serve to cancel  out  the  corporate  tax  relief  benefits  that  are  offered  through  the  EPZ,  and  reduce  the competitiveness  rating  and  perception  of  Namibia  as  an  investment  location.14  Likewise,  a  cost-benefit analysis of incentive programmes to attract FDI, such as the EPZ scheme, suggests that they have not been successful in delivering their stated aims. They have not been able to attract investments  that  are  export-oriented  and  labour-intensive  and  have  made  little  contribution towards the goals of generating employment, increasing export earnings, technology transfer and skills development.15 Equally, companies operating under the EPZ schemes have generated little backward  linkages  or  spillover  benefits  to  the  rest  of  the  economy.  The  scheme  has  generated substantial  costs  such  as:  foregone  tax  revenue;  administrative  and  promotional  costs;  capital outlays  for  infrastructural  development;  costs  of  purchasing  land;  subsidised  services;  public liability  in  the  case  of  publicly  owned  and  managed  companies;  and,  social  and  environmental costs.16 According to the authorities no land has been purchased for EPZ companies (in the case of Ramatex, land was leased) and capital outlays for infrastructural development is not limited to EPZ companies.', '3.78.

The  Namibia  Financial  Sector  Strategy  recommended  the  establishment  of  a  national venture capital fund/risk facility to bridge the financing gap that is experienced by SMEs. A project team comprising the Development Bank of Namibia, the Bank of Namibia, and GIZ commissioned a feasibility study conducted in two phases: assessment of the need for a risk finance facility; and the design of such a facility. Phase 1 of the feasibility study concluded with consensus on the need for multiple risk facilities and the emergence of the SME Financing Strategy. Three facilities for the SME Financing Strategy have been proposed: a credit guarantee scheme designed to address the challenge of inadequate collateral, a constraint faced by many MSMEs when applying for credit; a catalytic  first  loss  venture  capital  fund  designed  to  finance  the  growth-oriented  SMEs;  and  a challenge fund, a theme-based risk-sharing facility that will address the needs of MSMEs in terms of non-financial services that will enhance their growth and development. The three facilities are currently under consideration.']"
