The  institutional  framework  for  standards  and  technical  regulations  in  Saudi  Arabia remained largely unchanged since its previous review in 2012. The relevant legislation includes the Technical  Directive.20  The  TBT  enquiry  point  is  the  Saudi  Standards,  Metrology  and  Quality Organization, known as SASO.21', ""3.57.  The SASO notified 640 technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures to the WTO in the period from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2015. The notifications cover, inter alia, food and beverages, consumer chemicals, electrical equipment, plastics piping systems, and motor vehicles. The notifications normally specify a comment period of at least 60 days and a proposed date  of  adoption.  The  authorities  also  submitted  a  number  of  addenda,  providing  additional information on the adoption, entry into force, extension of comment period, and contents of the final text of previously notified TBT measures. Since the last review, some WTO Members in the TBT  Committee  expressed  their  concerns  about  Saudi's  technical  regulations  on  motor  vehicles, toys, and energy drinks.22"", '3.58.  Any interested party (i.e. the public sector, the private sector, academia, and members of the  public)  may  submit  proposals  for  national  standards  to  SASO.  All  draft  standards,  technical regulations,  and  conformity  assessments  are  made  available  on  the  SASO  website  for  public comment for at least 60 days. After the SASO Board of Directors approves a proposed standard, there  is  usually  a  period  of  six  months  between  final  publication  and  entry  into  force.  Technical committees make recommendations to the SASO Board of Directors on whether a standard should be  voluntary  or  mandatory.  According  to  the  authorities,  the  criteria  for  adopting  a  standard  as mandatory are based on the fulfilment of legitimate objectives such as protection of health, safety, national  security,  Islamic  law,  and  the  environment.  Currently,  there  are  1,820  technical regulations in force, 516 of which were adopted during 2012-15 (Table A3.2).', '3.59.  The  Technical  Directive,  requires  SASO  to  consider  relevant  international  standards  as  a basis for preparing national standards and technical regulations unless the international standards are ineffective (due to a climate or geographical factor, for instance) or inappropriate to achieve the intended, legitimate objectives (e.g. inconsistency with Islamic law). As of end-October 2015, there  were  28,924  national  standards  in  force.  According  to  the  authorities,  90%  of  Saudi standards  were  aligned  with  international  standards,  and  10%  were  developed/modified  to  suit specific situations in Saudi Arabia.', '3.60.

In general, GSO standards are based on international standards. Once a GSO  standard  is  approved,  each  GCC  member  State  may  transpose  it  into  a  national  standard through domestic legal procedures. According to the authorities, Saudi Arabia develops standards and  technical  regulations  at  its  national  level  only  when  there  is  a  pressing  need.  At  end-2015, 55% of Saudi standards in force were adopted from GCC standards.', ""3.61.  With regard to medical devices/products, the Medical Device Interim Regulation is applied to manufacturers, authorized representatives of overseas manufacturers, importers and distributors. It covers all medical devices, and their accessories, contact lenses and laser surgical equipment for cosmetic  rather  than  medical  purposes,  and  their  accessories.  Distributors,  importers  and authorized  representatives  of  medical  devices  must  obtain  a  licence  issued  by  the  SFDA;  and medical devices must obtain SFDA authorization before entering Saudi Arabia's market."", '3.62.  Products subject to technical regulations must comply with the relevant regulations before they are placed on the market. SASO may grant a certificate of conformity, or, for products that comply with standards and technical requirements, a licence to use the quality mark. The quality mark scheme is voluntary, and available for goods either domestically produced or imported.', '3.63.  All  consignments  of  imported  consumer  goods  must  be  accompanied  by  a  ""Certificate  of Conformity for commodities and products to be exported to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"", or the consignment  may  be  subject  to  random  sampling  in  the  port  for  laboratory  testing  to  verify conformity before clearing customs. The certificate of conformity may be issued by an accredited certification  body,  or  an  accredited  laboratory  as  a  third  party.  Saudi  Arabia  recognizes  the certification  bodies  accredited  by  the  accreditation  body  in  the  exporting  country  as  long  as  the accreditation  body  is  a  member  of  the  International  Accreditation  Forum  (IAF),  and  accepts  the certificates issued by these certification bodies.', '3.64.  Saudi  Arabia  has  signed  mutual  recognition  agreements  (MRAs)  with:  Argentina;  China; Egypt;  Germany;  Indonesia;  Jordan;  the  Republic  of  Korea;  Malaysia;  Pakistan;  the  Philippines; Singapore; South Africa; Tunisia; and Turkey.', '3.65.  Labels must be in Arabic in addition to any other language. A small number of products with labels only in English may be approved, on a case-by-case basis, for marketing test purposes. As an  Islamic  country,  Saudi  Arabia  has  strict  marking  and  labelling  requirements  for  meat  and poultry  products,  including  that  the  product  was  slaughtered  in  accordance  with  Islamic  halal procedures.']"
