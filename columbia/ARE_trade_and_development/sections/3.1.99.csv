Imports of a value not exceeding CFAF 2 million and imports of  a  large  number  of  products,  including  strategic  goods  such  as  crude  oil  and  the  equipment needed  for  petroleum  exploration  and  exploitation,  works  of  art,  precious  stones  and  metals, imports  under  the  free  zone  regime  (see  section  3.2.4  below)  are  exempt  in  order  to  facilitate import procedures according to the authorities.', 'to', '3.10.  A DI has to be made to the SGS for the purposes of inspection.

According  to  the  terms  of  its  contract  with  the  Government,  the  SGS  is  responsible for checking  the  quality,  quantity  and  value  of  imports,  as  well  as  their  classification. An ""inspection and control"" tax is levied at a rate of 0.95% of the f.o.b. value of the imports, with a  minimum  of  CFAF  110,000  per  delivery  or  shipment,  and  this  has  not  changed  since  1995.54 At a rate  of  0.95%,  the  flat  rate  of  CFAF  110,000  corresponds  to  imports  of  a  value of CFAF 11.6 million  (€17,700),  a  relatively  high  amount  for  individual  imports  into  Cameroon. In other words, imports whose value is less than this amount are subject to inspection costs much higher than 0.95%; for imports valued at CFAF 2 million, the CFAF 110,000 flat rate is equivalent to 5.5%.', '(see  below)  or  undergo  a', '3.12.

The SGS also undertakes the customs valuation of these  vehicles.  Since  the  2011  Finance  Law,  there  has  been  a  30%  reduction  on  the  taxable value of vehicles less than seven years old in order to encourage the rejuvenation of the vehicle fleet.

At  a  rate  of  0.95%,  the  annual  cost  of  the  mandatory  inspection  programme to the Cameroonian  economy  can  be  estimated  at  CFAF  20  billion  (€30  million).  Despite its objectives, the mandatory nature of this inspection raises the cost of imported goods because of  the  charges  importers  have  to  pay  (particularly  the  flat  rate)  and  increases  the  Customs workload.  At  present,  no  reform  is  envisaged  to  make  the  inspection  of  goods  imported  into Cameroon  non-mandatory.  Moreover,  the  DI  to  be  submitted  to  the  SGS and  the  corresponding import  inspection  declaration  (AVI)  have  not  been  dematerialized;  the  SGS  is  not  linked electronically  to  the  customs  computer  platform  (ASYCUDA++),  which  slows  down  the  import procedure and makes it more complicated.']"
